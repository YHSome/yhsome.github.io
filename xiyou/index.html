The surrounding sea, however, is particularly rich with life.

Our journey starts in the far southwest, in the oldest and strangest corner of the continent. Here the thirsty land is covered with thousands upon thousands of circles. We still don't know their origins. Poisonous plants, amazing insects and even magnetic forces have all been suggested, but each of them has then been ruled out.

Scott was a village headman. He was very clever. Once a thief stole some money from his neighbour Mr Dawson. The door of the house was not broken, and things in the room were in good order. It seemed that the thief was quite familiar with Mr Dawson's house. Therefore, Scott concluded that the thief must have been one of the villagers. That evening, Scott held a villagers' meeting. He said, "We don't know who stole the money. But God knows." He said that God sent his spider to tell good from evil, but few people noticed it. Then, all of a sudden, Scott waved his hand and cried out, "Look! The spider has landed on the thief's hat. It is going to bite him!" The crowd started making loud noise. Everybody turned to look for the thief. But soon the noise died down. All eyes were fixed on a man who was trying hard to drive the "spider" off his hat. "Now we know who stole the money," Scott said with a smile.

The universe is falling apart. Something is forcing galaxies to rush away from each other at ever increasing speeds. Ever since this alarming discovery, physicists have struggled to understand what might be causing it. So far, they've come up with a name. That is dark energy. Before the discovery of dark energy, physicists were confident in Einstein's theory of general relativity. But now things are less certain. So far, there is no one who can explain dark energy. It is possible that dark energy is not a thing at all, but just the evidence that the physics itself is wrong.

Civilisation is tied to landscapes. Landscapes help define who we are and where we call home. Yet landscape art hasn't always showed the way the world really is. It's often a response to the rapidly changing world. It can represent our values, and sometimes it can even allow us to take a break from real life. One of landscape art's greatest images was made in California. A young photographer had climbed a snowy mountain to take photos. But due to the bad weather, he failed to shoot according to his plan. Under pressure, he finally produced what many people consider one of the greatest masterpieces of landscape art.

Later, he felt hungry and wished for food. As he thought of that, a plate of delicious food appeared. Louis ate to his satisfaction. He felt as if he was in heaven, since all his desires were being fulfilled at once. He didn't realise that he was sitting under an unusual tree. It had the power to fulfil any desire. After eating the food, Louis thought again, "I am all alone in the forest. There are lots of wild animals that may come and kill me." As he thought so, a tiger appeared and came to attack him. Poor Louis was so scared that he could not even run. Finally, he was killed because of his negative thinking. It is said that a man is always led by his thoughts.

Louis was a trader. One day, he set out on a trade journey. While he was passing through a forest, he sat under a tree to have a rest. He felt thirsty and wanted something to drink. At that moment, there came a miracle. A bottle of water appeared. Louis was very surprised. But he was too thirsty to think much about that. So he drank it immediately. Later, he felt hungry and wished for food. As he thought of that, a plate of food appeared. Louis ate it up and felt satisfied. He felt as if he was in heaven, since all his desires were being fulfilled at once. He didn't realise that he was sitting under an unusual tree, which had the power to fulfil any desire. After eating the food, Louis thought that he was all alone in the forest and wild animals might come and kill him. As he thought so, a tiger appeared and attacked him. Poor Louis was so scared that he could not even run. At last, he was killed because of his negative thoughts. It is said that a man is always led by his thoughts.

It's the ten miles of atmosphere directly over our heads. That's the stage for one of the greatest shows on Earth. Suspended over two thirds of our planet's surface is an epic cast of infinitely varying forms, playing against the backdrop of night and day, 7, for over four billion years. Scaling higher than the tallest mountains, greater than all the oceans, more powerful than the mightiest volcanoes, clouds give our skies spectacle and drama. Clouds reveal the movement of air within the atmosphere. They're the bearers of fertility and nourishment, as well as the agents of terror and destruction.

Four and a half thousand years ago, in an age before metal, before the wheel, Stone Age Britons raised up one hundred and sixty-five colossal stones on a featureless English plain to famously celebrate sunrise on the longest day of the year and sunset on the shortest. But was all this built for just two days of the year? Pioneering technologies and gruesome discoveries are now revealing what really happened here to tell the full story of Stonehenge. Today, the Henge appears ruined, but there's order in the chaos and clues to this ancient site's former glory. Although Stonehenge is famous as a celestial temple, archaeologists suspect a monument this big must have attracted other uses.

Across the world, many species are hurtling toward extinction in what some scientists describe as a biological annihilation. The US and Canada have lost around three billion birds since nineteen seventy. That's around one in every four. This may be, in part, due to plummeting numbers of insects.

Insects are the most diverse and abundant animals on the planet. But over the last three decades, they have been disappearing at an astonishing rate.

Tom was a college student who was always alone. His teacher noticed this and once asked him the reason after class.

After hearing Tom's story, the teacher thought for a while and invited Tom to her home.

At the appointed time, Tom reached the teacher's home. While preparing the lemonade, the teacher intentionally added more salt and kept the content of sugar low. Then Tom took a sip of that lemonade and made a strange face. "If you don't like it, I can throw it away," the teacher said. As she was about to do that, Tom stopped her, "Ms Lee, there's just a bit of extra salt in it. If we add a little more sugar to it, then it will be perfectly fine to drink." Listening to this, the teacher smiled and said that it was what she wanted to hear. She hoped Tom could erase the bitter experience by adding some sweet memories to his life.

Victorian Britain was the most powerful nation on Earth. And Victorian painters caught the spirit of this great national journey. They may not be fashionable now, but these pictures show us how the Victorians saw themselves. They celebrated Britain's great achievements. As the first industrial power bursting with technological inventions. As a commercial superpower. As the mightiest naval and military force the world had ever seen. Ruling an empire four times greater than that of ancient Rome, Britain's enormous strength abroad triggered huge social change at home, as power began to shift away from the aristocracy towards ordinary people.

Once a traveller from a faraway place came to a king's court. The traveller wore a big and beautiful hat that no one in the country had seen before. The king would like to buy that hat, so he asked the traveller how much it was. The traveller replied that it cost one thousand gold coins.

Once upon a time, a traveller who came from a faraway place visited a king with a big and beautiful hat. No one in the country had seen such a beautiful hat before. The king wanted to buy that hat and asked the traveller about its price. The traveller answered that it cost one thousand gold coins. Then one minister told the king that the hat was not worth it. From the minister's face, the traveller knew what he must have said to the king. Then he said he was told that only the greatest king there could afford to buy it. He also added that if it was not the kingdom, he was going to leave and keep looking for the right one. At that time, the king brought one thousand gold coins and bought the hat right away. The minister was shocked by seeing this. After the deal was done, the traveller spoke very quietly to the minister that he might know the price of the hat, but he didn't know the king's weakness.

Out of the blue, a giant emerges from the deep. Right now, the monster moves silently, but it's equipped with an awesome force. Some of the largest waves in the world break on South Pacific islands. Their birth sums up the scale of this ocean. The storm swell that made these waves has travelled three thousand miles to reach this shallow reef. These distances proved a great challenge for animal castaways, but when they found new land, many evolved into new species. Human colonisers followed similar routes, and the ocean that isolated them from the rest of the world became central to their culture.

The Other Side of the Wall

Mary lived in a small house with her grandma. There was a beautiful garden behind their house. Mary loved gardening and was very proud of her garden. One day, she saw a very beautiful plant in a book and wanted to plant it in her garden. She asked her grandma if she knew the plant. Grandma recognised it and got the seed for Mary.

Christmas dinner, for some of us, is heaven. For others, it's hell. Christmas dinner is a time when we're expected to get together full of the spirit of good cheer, stuffing our faces and drinking ourselves into oblivion; a time when class, anxiety and bad temper all bubble up and spew forth over the dinner table. It's a time just for family, and a time we let our hair down, put on silly hats and quite literally go crackers. It's a feast that unites but also divides. At this time of year, one way or another, we all end up stuffed.

Tom was an artist. He wanted to paint the most beautiful thing in the world, but he didn't know what it was. So he started a journey to search for an answer.

At first, he met a priest. Tom asked him where he could find the most beautiful thing in the world. The priest let him go to the church and said "faith" is the most beautiful thing in the world. Later, Tom met a happy bride at a wedding. She told him the most beautiful thing is "love". Soon Tom met a tired soldier who firmly believed "peace" is the most beautiful, because wars destroyed beauty but "peace" sheltered it.

"How can I paint ‘faith', ‘love' and ‘peace'?" thought Tom. With the question, Tom returned home. When he arrived, his wife and children ran to him happily and said they had prayed for his safety since he left. On their faces, Tom saw "love" and "faith". They hugged each other and Tom felt at peace. He realised that his search was over. He then painted the most beautiful thing in the world and titled it "home".

Tom walked his dog around the lake near his house every Sunday morning. Week after week, he saw the same elderly woman sitting at the edge of the water with a small metal cage next to her. Tom's curiosity finally got the best of him and he approached the woman one day. He noticed that the cage was actually a small trap and she had three small turtles in it. On her lap, there was a fourth turtle that she was carefully wiping down with a sponge.

Tom greeted the woman and asked what she was doing with those turtles. The elderly woman smiled and explained to him that she was cleaning their shells because any algae that builds up on a turtle's shell reduces its ability to absorb heat and slows down its swimming. It can also weaken the shell over time.

"You're kind to do this, but are you really making a difference if most turtles don't have people around to clean their shells?" Tom asked. The woman laughed as she looked down at the small turtle on her lap. "Young man, if this little turtle could talk, he would say I'm making all the difference in the world."

Admit Your Mistakes

Tom liked making toys by himself. One day, Tom made a toy for shooting stones. He wondered whether it could work well. So he went towards the forest to test it. However, he never succeeded in shooting the target once. It got late, so he had to head back for dinner. While walking back, he saw his grandma's pet duck and he shot towards it for fun. But he was shocked that the duck was shot and wounded. Tom got scared. He didn't dare to tell his grandma about it. But, his sister Mary saw all. Mary didn't say anything about the duck to their grandma. But she threatened Tom. If he didn't obey her, she would tell their grandma about it. So whenever their grandma asked Mary for help, she would just ask Tom to do that work instead. Finally Tom couldn't stand it any longer. He told his grandma everything. His grandma gave him a hug and told him that she saw the whole thing when it happened. "It was a mistake, but I forgave you. I didn't say a word because I was wondering how long you would let your sister make a slave of you," she said.

There are over half a million people in Britain who experience the world very differently to the rest of us. These are people with autism. A puzzling condition which 70 years after it was first given a name, we still know very little about. Autism takes on many forms and exists on a wide spectrum, from mild to severe. It was, and still is, characterized by the difficulty these children have communicating and interacting with others and by their tendency to have very narrow interests and to repeat activities over and over again.

The next day, he invited many famous painters to the court and announced that he wanted a beautiful portrait to be placed in the palace. Any painter who could carry out this would be rewarded. But the painters began to think that it was impossible to make the portrait beautiful because Tom was physically disabled. They were afraid that Tom would get angry and punish them. So all of them made excuses and politely declined to paint the portrait. But suddenly one painter said that he could paint it and started painting. After a long time, the portrait was ready. All the people were curious and nervous. When the painter presented the portrait, everyone was amazed. In the portrait, Tom was sitting on the horse on the one-leg side, holding his bow and aiming the arrow with his one eye closed. The painter painted a beautiful portrait by cleverly hiding Tom's disabilities. Tom was very pleased and gave him a great reward.

Why are we humans so vulnerable to disease? Are we destined to live in fear of illness? The answer is hidden in the history of human evolution. Every year, as many as 16 million people around the world suffer strokes. Without immediate treatment, stroke can be life-threatening. Surprisingly, few cases of stroke have been confirmed in animals other than humans. When mankind first started walking its unique evolutionary path, the seeds of the disease were sown. Blood vessels in the brain became more susceptible to stroke. But people who continue to live as our ancestors did long ago are free of the disease.

These are the good times, but in just a few months, all this fresh growth will be gone, and the animals will be forced to move on. That is the way things are on grasslands across the planet.

Light reveals the wonders of our universe in all their glory — stars being born in distant realms and galaxies frozen in time. But light is also a messenger from a long-forgotten era, and contained in the light from the most distant stars in the cosmos is the story of our universe's origin. Through light, we can stare back across the entire history of the universe, and ultimately see how light breathed life into us.

An Unexpected Discovery

Tom was a young chemist. One evening, he was so absorbed in doing an experiment in his lab that he forgot about his supper till quite late. Hungry, he rushed home for supper without washing his hands. His wife had cooked some bread. Tom broke off a piece of bread and took a bite of it. Unusually, the bread tasted extremely sweet. He asked his wife if she had added anything to the bread to make it so sweet. However, she told him she hadn't and she tasted nothing strange about it. Tom was confused and wondered what caused the sweetness of the bread. Then he rinsed his mouth with water, and dried his moustache with a napkin. To his surprise, the napkin was sweeter than the bread! Tom looked at his hands for a while and then realised that he forgot to wash his hands before supper. He licked his fingers and tasted the sweetness, so he thought the sweet taste was probably from one of the chemicals in his lab. He dropped his dinner and ran back to the lab. There he licked everything he used for the experiment. Luckily, he discovered a new chemical that can be used as a substitute for sugar.

Despite that, the gathering crabs begin to measure each other up and then they do something rather extraordinary. They arrange themselves into an orderly queue. The biggest at the front, smallest at the back, they are lining up with one aim — to exchange properties. But none of the crabs can make a move, because the change is not yet complete.

It's morning and the kittens are hungry, but a mother can't hunt with four excitable youngsters. Today, she will have to leave her kittens home alone. Out here, in the open, there's nowhere to hide. The only thing she can do is to try and blend in. Her ears are positioned unusually low on the side of its head, and that helps her to keep a low profile. What's more, she can flatten her body to observe the prey, like a rock. She'll need to hunt all day to provide enough food for her growing kittens, who, meanwhile, are getting up to all sorts of tricks.

A Friend Who Repeats

Tom was a little boy who moved slowly and responded slowly. But there was something even worse. Since his early childhood, Tom was not able to speak properly. He had to always repeat his words three to four times, trying to get the sentences right. When it was time for him to go to primary school, his mother Mary became very concerned. She was worried that her son would be laughed at by classmates, and that he would have lunch alone and get lost when going home alone. To Mary's surprise, everything seemed to be going on very well. Tom returned from school with a lot of new things to share every day. So Mary visited Tom's school one day and she found the boys playing basketball together happily. Though Tom was hit by the ball six times, he was not laughed at. Instead, his classmates and teachers all helped him in this or that way. The boys said they loved to have a friend like Tom, because they would never forget any homework or what teachers asked them to do. Tom was able to help by repeating the teachers' words. Hearing this, Mary felt relaxed. She didn't have to worry about her son any more.

A huge poster was posted on the board of the town hall. It was written in bold letters: FAMINE IN AFRICA~ PLEASE GIVE GENEROUSLY TO SAVE THE STARVING PEOPLE.

A large crowd was queuing to give their donations. Near the door of the town hall stood a beautiful young girl, poorly but neatly dressed. Her name was Mary. With shy glances she watched the people before her. She saw a merchant who laid a bag of gold on the table. Then came a rich lady with proud looks who offered a variety of jewels; some others handed cash, clothes and food. Mary hesitated to take her turn, but at last, she got up her courage and stepped forward.

"But ... it is so small that I am ashamed to offer it. It seems worthless, but it is all I have," she said. "We are grateful for even the smallest offering," the man at the counter replied kindly. "Here it is. I have nothing else to give," she added shyly. She opened her cloth bag and took out two long thick plaits of her golden hair. The man was surprised and then realized that she had cut her long hair. She donated her most priceless possession, which overshadowed all the shining gold or jewels.
