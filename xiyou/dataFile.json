As well as growing new talents, we also think of this stage of childhood as a time of growing upwards. But the strange thing is our growth actually slows right down.

We simply can't get enough calories to fully grow both at the same time.\nW: Tom, have you ever read the novel Out of Africa?\nM: Yes. It's one of my favourite novels.

He found himself in a blacking factory by the river Thames, putting labels on bottles of shoe polish.

His mother worked hard every day, but they were always poor. One day, Tom stole his friend's pencil. His mother praised him instead of scolding him. The next time, he stole a watch. His mother praised him again. A few years later, Tom grew up and became a young man. He stole jewellery and brought it to his mother. His mother liked it very much and praised him again.

Tom said if she had scolded him like that when he stole the first pencil, he could not have become a thief. Only then did his mother realise she had made a big mistake. She regretted praising him for whatever he did.\n叙述要点：\n1. Tom lived together with his mother in a house.\n2.

Each South Pacific island has its own unique set of creatures. Surrounded by water, the ocean became embedded in their culture — sometimes in surprising ways. The size of many South Pacific islands means that food is often limited. The smaller and more isolated they are, the harder it is to survive. And in this ocean of islands, there’s one tiny island that stands out. It’s home to perhaps the most remote community of people on the planet, with a truly inspiring story. Their approach ensures a future for the next generation to enjoy.</blockquote>\n\n\n2.

Actually, she was slim when she was in middle school. After she went to high school, her mother was too busy to cook for the family. Therefore, Mary often ate in fast food restaurants or simply had some snacks. As a result, she put on weight quickly. After two years, her weight almost doubled. Tired of being laughed at, she made up her mind to lose weight in the beginning of Grade 12. From then on, she got up early every morning and ran for at least half an hour. Besides, she also exercised in the gym twice a week and swam for one hour each weekend. Before going to college, she had been successful in losing weight. Now she looks good again. </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Mary was seriously overweight when she was in high school. People often laughed at her because of her weight. Actually, Mary was not like this when she was in middle school.

But you don’t need to go into the wild to find it, or even a zoo. Its natural habitat is your living room. And that animal is the dog. For over 40 years, Horizon and the BBC have been examining the nature of dogs, in a bid to better understand the intense and often complex relationship we have with them, from discovering their origins to revealing our own role in the dogs’ evolution. Scientists have tried to decipher dogs’ often puzzling behavior, and have discovered the impact of our wildly varying attitude towards them.</blockquote>\n\n\n2.

One fifth of all river water on Earth travels through it. But when this gargantuan river overflows, it transforms itself. The waters rise so high. The great forests on either side change from being dry land, to becoming a magical water world, a vast flooded forest covering an area the size of California where fish swim through the trees.</blockquote>\n\n\n2.

When asked why he waited that long, Sam gave his answer. When a drowning person is struggling in the water, one should not jump into the water to save him at once. If not, it is likely that both of them are dragged into the water and get drowned. So it’s better to wait for the chance until he becomes tired after struggling.

Today Los Angeles is a city with every luxury and convenience. Yet not so long ago at the turn of the last century, Los Angeles was struggling. LA’s problem was its location, hemmed there on three sides by desert and on the fourth by ocean. So it led to the most basic requirement for city life — a reliable water supply.</blockquote>\n\n\n2.

He wanted to tell the waiter to bring him something to eat in this way. But each time the waiter brought him something to drink, not food to eat. He was about to leave the restaurant when a young man came in. Tom saw the young man put his hands on his stomach. The waiter brought the young man a large plate of bread and meat in a few minutes. Tom realized he used the wrong body language, so he did the same thing as the young man after he went back to his seat.

The urge to make things beyond the demands of shelter or sustenance pushed us to build something greater and more lasting than ourselves. Objects, images and buildings engage with the world around us and startle us out of daily routine. They transform what it feels like to be human, and to live richly and fully, creating cultures as well as communities and building civilisations. Art is history. It records the rise and fall of empires, changes to the world around us, trade routes that brought to us new colours and new ideas from across the globe.</blockquote>\n\n\n2.

It will carry a device for detecting cosmic rays, tiny particles from the beginning of time that are only now reaching Earth.

One day, when having a walk in the nearby park, he saw his classmate Jane playing table tennis with a boy there. The boy always lost the games. To show his excellent skills, Tom offered to play against Jane. At first, Tom’s scores were far more than Jane’s. However, Jane won the game in the end. Tom felt very ashamed. Through the match, Tom realized that Jane was a better player and that he would need more practise to beat her. Therefore, he practised table tennis every day after school for several months.

During the [15th/fifteenth] century, European sailors embarked on a new age of exploration. Cultures that previously were vast oceans apart now met for the first time. But before this became a story of conquest, plunder and empire, there was a forgotten era of discovery. And for many, this was a golden age, when curiosity, mutual respect and exchange of goods and ideas were recorded in the art of countless human encounters. These are the Benin Bronzes. Looted from Africa in the [19th/nineteenth] century, they are now recognised as one of the continent’s greatest artistic masterpieces.</blockquote>\n\n\n2.

His mom didn’t know that. On Tom’s way to the shoe store, he saw a house that had Christmas lights and other decorations. Then he realized his family had no Christmas decorations, nor Christmas food. Then he began to have a sense of guilt, for he was going to buy a pair of shoes for himself while his mother was sad because she couldn’t afford anything for Christmas. It was then he knew what he should do — he should buy Christmas food for his family. He bought a turkey, some ham and some other Christmas treats in a grocery. Then Tom piled them against the door of his home quietly and knocked at the door. When his mom opened the door, with great excitement, he said Merry Christmas to her and told her that there was really a Santa Claus.</blockquote>\n\n\n#####\n答案相对路径：完整套题/高三/模拟试题29.txt\n模拟试题29\n\n1. <blockquote> A leafcutter ant has left the security of its family to scout for food. Ants use their antennae to detect food. This is fuel for the colony. Within minutes, fellow workers are by her side, having followed a trail of chemicals that she has deliberately left behind her. The ants must work fast. Down here, exhaust fumes can create a thick toxic smog. Now they must take the long road home, back to the rest of the colony. As the first worker ants reach the safety of the underground colony, city life is about to come crashing in on their world. </blockquote>\n\n\n2.

There are moons with giant volcanoes, moons with vast oceans sealed under thick ice. And now we know a few are rich in organic compounds. In the right combination they might even support life. At first glance, moons don’t look ideal for life. Take Enceladus, it’s a shiny ball of ice, [300/three hundred] miles across, orbiting Saturn. In [2005/two thousand five], the Cassini probes spotted ice volcanoes erupting from the surface of Enceladus. That meant there had to be heat under all that ice, heat that created oceans of water.

He went through many treatments but none of them worked. One day, he approached a wise monk who offered a special solution to his eye pain. The monk told him to concentrate only on green color for a few weeks and avoid any other colors. The man was desperate to get rid of the pain, so he listened to the monk. He bought a lot of green paint and appointed painters to paint every object green. After a few weeks, the monk came to visit the man. He saw the whole hallway and the room had been painted green and asked the man why. The man said he was only following the monk’s advice to look at only green.

It was dangerous at night, so the owner answered the door with her gun. When she opened the door, she saw a person turning round and walking away. The owner cried, “Freeze!” But the man went on walking. The owner thought he was trying to escape, so she shot him dead. The dead man turned out to be a Japanese exchange student. He went to visit a friend but could not remember the number of the house. When he realized he had gone to the wrong house, he turned round to leave. He didn’t understand the command “Freeze!” In the United States, people usually use it when they are ready to use the gun, and if the person moves, they will shoot.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>In Los Angeles, somebody rang the doorbell of a house one evening. The place was dangerous at night, so the owner of the house took the gun with her to answer the door. She saw a person when she opened the door. The person turned around and began to walk away. Seeing this, the owner said, “Freeze!” But the man didn’t stop. The owner believed he wanted to escape, so she shot him dead. Later, a sad story was discovered. The dead man was an exchange student from Japan. He was looking for his friend’s house, but he didn’t remember its number. When he found he had arrived at the wrong house, he decided to leave. He didn’t know much English and could not understand the word “freeze”. Actually it means “stand still and don’t move”. In America, people usually use “Freeze!” when they are ready to shoot. And they will do that if the person doesn’t obey this command.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>One evening, someone rang the doorbell of a house in Los Angeles.

These distances proved a great challenge for animal castaways, but when they found new land, many evolved into new species. Human colonisers followed similar routes, and the ocean that isolated them from the rest of the world became central to their culture.\n\n三问五答：\nM: Hey, Mary.

The driver explained that there were so many people full of anger and disappointment, so Tom didn't have to take it personally.

The only thing that made her happy was a dozen red roses from her boyfriend. As she was cleaning up, a young tired-looking woman came into her room with her son. Nervously, she explained that her husband who was a prisoner was the next patient. She begged Mary to let him sit in the waiting room with her, as long as possible before sending him back to prison. Mary agreed as it was Christmas Eve and she just wanted to help. After the woman’s husband came, the family enjoyed the time together for over half an hour. At the end of the visit, the man felt sad because he couldn’t give his wife a Christmas gift. On hearing this, Mary handed the roses to the surprised man who presented them to his wife.</blockquote>\n93. \n93. <blockquote>It was the afternoon of December [24/the twenty-fourth], the day before Christmas.

Invoking the gods in their prayers, the wise man could work cures or see the future. But because they didn't want these magical powers to fall into enemy hands, they never left anything written down and tried to keep all their knowledge secret. Because of this, we know very little about them. We, in modern times, sometimes imagine them as tall, thin men with long, white beards. These wise men were called “Druids”, and were very respected. Tribal chiefs always asked them for advice before making a decision. The Druids knew about the healing powers of forest plants.</blockquote>\n2. Will you throw away the old toothbrush right away?\n2.

One evening, he was walking along a road. He kept looking up at the stars and thought the end of the world was near. Lost in his thoughts, he kept walking without looking down. Suddenly, he fell into a small pond, but he couldn’t swim. He tried hard to get out but failed, so he screamed for help. Hearing his screams, the villages came to help him. One villager told Tom that he pretended to read the future in the stars, but he failed to see what was at his feet. We should pay more attention to what is in front of us and let the future take care of itself.</blockquote>\n334. \n334. <blockquote>Tom was a fortune teller.

They came from the kingdoms of the Europe in the Middle Ages. Thirsting after conquest, trade and wealth, they exported their civilization from their little corner of Western Europe to every corner of the world. Before long, Western civilization became the world’s dominant civilization. The West taught the rest its way of doing business, its scientific method, its law and its politics, its way of dressing, of speaking, and of praying.

Before she left, she asked Mike to stay near the door and watch it all the time. She said this because she was worried about thieves. So Mike sat down beside the door. An hour later, one of his uncles came. He asked Mike where his mother was. Mike said she had gone to the river to do some washing. Then his uncle said they were going to visit Mike’s family three hours later. He asked Mike to go and tell his mother about it, because he was too busy and had to hurry. After his uncle had left, Mike began to think about what he should do. He thought and thought. At last, he pulled down the door and put it on his back, and then went to the river.</blockquote>\n107. \n107. <blockquote>One day, little Mike’s mother went to the river to do some washing. Before she went away, she told Mike to stay near the door and watch it all the time while she was away. She said this because she was afraid of thieves. Mike sat down beside the door. After an hour, his uncle came. He asked Mike, “Where is your mother?” Mike answered, “She had gone to the river to do some washing.” Then his uncle said, “Now it is a quarter to two. Three hours later, we’re going to visit your family. Go and tell her about it, for I’m too busy. I have to hurry.” After his uncle had gone away, Mike started to think, “Mother had asked me to watch the door all the time, and my uncle told me to go and tell my mother. What shall I do?” He thought and thought. In the end, he pulled down the door and put it on his back. Then he went to the river.</blockquote>\n#####题目名称: 2025年压轴试题7\n1. <blockquote>The Celts believed that words had magical powers. Invoking the gods in their prayers, the wise man could work cures or see the future. But because they didn't want these magical powers to fall into enemy hands, they never left anything written down and tried to keep all their knowledge secret. Because of this, we know very little about them. We, in modern times, sometimes imagine them as tall, thin men with long, white beards. These wise men were called “Druids”, and were very respected. Tribal chiefs always asked them for advice before making a decision. The Druids knew about the healing powers of forest plants.</blockquote>\n2. Will you throw away the old toothbrush right away?\n2.

He thought he was poor because he was unlucky, so he never worked hard. One day, Tom met an old man and told him about his poor life. The old man gave Tom a beautiful vase and said the vase would save him from a poor life. Tom took the vase and brought it home. He thought the beautiful vase shouldn’t be empty, so he picked some flowers and put them into the vase. Then he thought the vase shouldn’t stand next to a dirty wall, so he started cleaning his house. He was happy to see the house became bright and tidy after his hard work.

Workers were asked to put some money in a donation box. Tom passed on the box without putting anything in because there was only on dollar in his wallet.

We have the vision to create a very different future. With human innovation and technology, we have the power to chart a more sustainable course. It could be that we are living through the defining moment in human evolution, the time when our civilization breaks the mode and chooses to succeed.</blockquote>\n2. What was his first job?\n2.

Well aware of the danger, they stay in the deep water as long as they can, but they can only hold their breath for about 20 minutes. Catching a four-metre-long whale that weighs one tonne is no easy task, even if that whale is weakened by starvation. Day by day, as the hole gets bigger, it becomes increasingly difficult for the bear to land a whale. It may have taken a long time and a lot of patience, but a catch when it’s made brings abundant rewards.</blockquote>\n2. Are dancing and music what she’s interested in?\n2.

And there’s one food above all others that shows just how far we’re willing to push those limits. We’ve come to a hot chili-eating competition in the American Mid West, to find out just how far the human sense of taste can go. Keeping watch in the audience is Professor Paul Jones, who’s spent years studying why we keep coming back for the burn.</blockquote>\n2. How do you prepare for the dancing contest?\n2.

In his mind, being a doctor was a great job, so he felt very excited. And he was also proud to be able to help people. On the first day of his new job, the young dentist got up early in the morning and went to his clinic happily. After he arrived at his clinic, he put on his doctor’s coat and waited for his first patient to come. He waited for about an hour until a middle-aged man came in and asked for help. The man had a toothache and wanted his bad tooth removed. The young dentist knew the time had come, and he couldn’t wait to make his dream come true. When everything was ready, the young dentist suddenly became nervous because it was his first time to pull out a tooth for a real patient. He tried his best to stay calm and keep his mind clear. That helped him focus on his work and gain confidence. The young dentist finally removed the tooth. He was satisfied with his work. He was going to throw the tooth away, but he dropped the tooth into the man’s throat.

Today it’s the capital of Italy and is as busy and exciting as ever. The city is packed with things to see and renting a scooter is an excellent way to get around. It costs only [$20/twenty dollars] a day and can give you instant Italian style but prepare for some pretty crazy driving because Italians are famous for ignoring red lights, stop signs and even people! You should also visit the ancient stadium. Long ago, it hosted battles between human and lions, watched by thousands of people. But don’t worry.

Only a young woman and her two baby daughters were unhurt. It was winter, and the ground was covered in thick snow. When it grew dark, the woman turned a suitcase into a bed and put the children inside. She covered them with all the clothes she could find to keep them warm. During the night, it got terribly cold. The woman kept as near as she could to the children. Early the next morning, she heard planes passing overhead so she sent a signal by stamping out the letters “SOS” in the snow. Thankfully, a pilot saw the signal and sent a message to the nearest town. Soon after, a helicopter arrived and rescued the mother and her children.</blockquote>\n288. \n288. <blockquote>A few years ago, a plane crashed in the mountains. The pilot was dead.

When he got there, he was so happy to see so many strange things, especially the fresh and colorful fruit. In one shop, the traveler was glad to see a kind of very long, red fruit and it was very cheap. He felt thirsty, so he bought a kilo of the fruit and started eating it. But soon his mouth started burning, and his face turned red. He called for help loudly. However, he didn’t realize the fruit was the cause of his burning, so he continued eating as he called out for help. People told him to stop eating the fruit because it was red pepper! But the man didn’t listen to the advice. He thought he had paid for the fruit and there was no reason to waste the money. So he kept eating the red pepper, jumping up and down. </blockquote>\n231. \n231. <blockquote>Long long ago, a foreign man took a trip to India to explore new things there.

It is made up of almost [3,000/three thousand] different reefs, each with a different personality. But it is most famous for its underwater world. Here, there is more life than almost anywhere else on Earth. Many of the creatures are very beautiful but some seem straight out of science fiction. Others can kill in an instant.

He often felt worried, until one night he thought of a plan. The next morning, he found a large wooden box, filled it, locked it up and put it in the kitchen. The next time his sons came to have dinner, they noticed the box and asked what was inside. The old man answered there were just some things he’d been saving. His sons thought the box must be full of gold. They decided to protect the treasure and take turns living with their old father. Several years later, the old father died. After the funeral, the sons found the key to the box. When they unlocked it, they found it full of stones.

Had it not been for some friendly Indians, they would never have survived. They knew nothing about planting crops, hunting animals, building grass houses, or making clothing from animal skins. Life in England had been much easier. The settlers were taught to build canoes and make snowshoes. The Indians also showed them how to burn trails through the forest, hunt large animals and trap smaller ones, and spear fish. The natives also introduced to the settlers typical foods such as turkey and corn. Everything possible was done to make their new settlement similar to the homes they had left behind. </blockquote>\n2. What do farmers use to grow organic foods?\n2.

It represents the military might of the state of Prussia and Prussia’s determination to create a greater Germany. For a thousand years and more, Germany had been weak, divided, an easy target for foreign invaders. This monument declares that under Prussian leadership, and with Prussian technology, that will never happen again. “Let us arm, let us fight, let us unite.” “Let us build a great military machine.”</blockquote>\n2.

George agreed and several years later they got married. George was good at cooking, and he made a lot of delicious food for his wife. Gradually, his wife became much fatter and one day, she found there was something wrong with her heart. But George wasn’t at home, so she had to go to hospital alone. The doctor checked on her health and told her not to eat meat, sugar, chocolate and other sweet things. She wrote down all the names of the food on a paper. When she got home, she put the list on the table and went to sleep. When she woke up, she found many kinds of food, including meat, sugar and chocolate in the kitchen. As soon as George saw her, he said happily that he had bought all the food she liked. </blockquote>\n146. \n146. <blockquote>Before Mr. Li died, he asked a young man to look after his daughter.

They’re certainly endearing creatures. Of course, we’re used to seeing them in the frozen vastness of Antarctica, but there’s one penguin that has chosen a different path. Yes, this is a penguin taking a stroll in a forest. With no natural ground predators, it’s a safe place to nest. Like any self-respecting penguin, they still love fish, which are understandably in short supply in the forest. Every day, the adults shuffle back and forth to the sea to feed, using crystal-clear forest streams as convenient highways. </blockquote>\n2. Why is exercise so important?\n2.

The man liked listening to radio and always played it loudly. The first time Mary went upstairs, he said he didn’t know Mary could hear the radio. Mary said she could hear every word, and he said he would turn it down. The next day, he again played his radio very loudly. When Mary rushed upstairs, he again promised he would turn his radio down. But when Mary returned home, the radio was louder than before. This time, Mary went upstairs with her baseball bat. She screamed at him like a crazy person, and told him she would kill him if he didn’t turn the radio down. Since then, Mary never heard the noise again.</blockquote>\n239. \n239. <blockquote>Mary liked everything of her apartment. However, things changed after a young man moved into upstairs.

The Dartford warbler looks quite different to any other small birds that you’ll see in Wales. The view doesn’t matter. What’s more important is that he’s found in a small patch where he can sing and nest. But he’ll have to sing very loud above the traffic noise, and this is something all urban birds have to get used to. This is a city in North Wales. It’s early morning and the traffic is very busy. In the park, birds are also getting on with their busy lives. </blockquote>\n2. What’s the cost of riding a shared bike?\n2. How much does it cost to ride a shared bike?\n2.

There is a complete network of bicycle lanes citywide. They have the bicycle lanes next to the sidewalks. Sidewalks are the slow traffic. The bike lanes are a little bit faster, and then there would be parked cars, and then there would be the traffic. In this way you have the parked cars to protect the bicyclists. It helps invite a lot of people who would be too afraid to bicycle to get the idea that “I can actually do it also, because now it is much safer.” </blockquote>\n2. What do you like doing?\n2.

He thought the man must be a thief, so he called the police and waited there. The police came when the man was coming out of the house. They found that the man wasn’t a thief but was a taxi driver. He drove Ms. Smith back but Ms. Smith had no money on her. She got into the house to get the money but didn’t come out. The driver knocked on the door and got no answer, so he decided to climb in through the window to have a look. It turned out that Ms. Smith had fallen asleep.

Nature is beginning to wind down. But for Scotland’s farmers, the hard work never stops. It’s one of the busiest times of the year. On the west coast of Scotland, Sandy and David run a traditional hill farm. They keep cattle and sheep, which for much of the year roam freely over [3,000/three thousand] acres. Today, they’re rounding up a group of sheep. The sheep need to be brought in off the hills for a health check. On a hill farm, livestock are truly free-range. Farmers spend many hours rounding up their sheep.</blockquote>\n2. How many shows were there at the concert?\n2. How many shows were put on at the concert?\n2.

After searching for some days in vain, they made wishes to God. At first, they wished for food, and the next morning Tom saw a tree with apples, but Mary got nothing. Then, Tom wished for clothes and a house, and he got all of them the next day, but Mary still had nothing. Finally, Tom wished for a ship, and again he found a ship. He boarded the ship and decided to leave Mary on the island. When he was about to leave, a voice from heaven asked him why he left his friend on the island. Tom said Mary deserved nothing because God had ignored all her wishes.

So they raised the baby eagle as a baby chicken. The eagle believed he was a chicken when he grew up. One day, when the eagle saw other eagles flying in the sky, he wanted to fly like them. Other chickens laughed at him and told him that he couldn’t fly. Each time the eagle talked about his dream, other chickens insisted that his dream would not come true. The eagle believed them. After that, the eagle stopped dreaming and continued to live a life as a chicken. Finally, after a long life as a chicken, the eagle passed away.</blockquote>\n169. \n169. <blockquote> Once upon a time, an eagle’s egg was dropped in a chicken farm by accident.

And what’s more, they throw light on some of the great mysteries of evolution. Why have the birds of paradise become the most diverse, bizarre and beautiful of all bird families? Why have they developed the most extravagant plumes and adornments of any group of living things on Earth, so that sometimes, they almost cease to look like birds at all? And why is it that this extraordinary family is largely restricted to one jungle-covered island in the Pacific?</blockquote>\n2. What’s the Student Union responsible for?\n2.

But the loss of sea ice isn’t just an issue for the Arctic, because the state of the ice affects the climate of the whole planet. Because it’s white, the ice reflects up to [90%/ninety percent] of the Sun’s energy. This is called the albedo effect and it’s why we often see heat haze in the Arctic. Because sea water is dark, it absorbs most of the Sun’s heat. In the Arctic, this can trigger a chain reaction, as the warming water melts more ice, exposing more water to the Sun’s heat.</blockquote>\n2. What are your main duties in the gallery?\n2.

For Russian hamsters, it’s all about running. In nature, they cover six miles a night. They can cover the same distance by running on the spot. And it seems they do it for fun! When scientists placed a wheel in the wild, mice took to it just as keenly as this enthusiastic hamster. Like human athletes, exercise creates a rush of endorphins. He experiences a runner’s high. At full speed, he reaches [600/six hundred] strides a minute — four times more than the fastest racehorse. Moving X-ray shows that, unlike horses, even when flat out he always keeps one foot on the ground. </blockquote>\n2. What are plastic bags made of?\n2. What are plastic bags made from?\n2.

Physicists have discovered that this special metal was created in outer space long before our planet existed. Over 5 billion years ago, gold and other heavy-metal atoms formed in a giant dying star.

People in his town thought he was both poor and foolish, and they felt sorry for him. They gave him old clothes, left-over food and even a small old house to live in. Hugo lived on these donations made by kind people. One day, Hugo showed up at the village square, wearing a brand new suit. Everybody was amazed, because few people in the town could afford new clothes, let alone a nice suit. People asked him where he got his suit, thinking he had stolen it. But Hugo said he bought it. He added that the fine new house being built on the side of the mountain was his. People questioned where he got the money. He answered that he sold everything the townsmen gave him and got some money. Then he used the money to do business and made a huge fortune. “You may think I’m not clever, but I’m no fool,” Hugo smiled and gave out hundreds of dollar bills to those who had been kind to him.</blockquote>\n#####题目名称: 考前冲刺8\n1. <blockquote>The mother’s hungry, and if she doesn’t eat soon, the milk her cubs need will dry up. There is a long, dangerous journey ahead of them. The mother needs to get her cubs down to the coast, and she hopes that the salmon will be plentiful this summer, but there is no guarantee. Her two cubs’ survival depends on it. Now they need to get on the move. What an amazing place to take their first steps. These little cubs will have to be brave from the second their paws touch the snow. They’ve got to get all the way across these frozen mountains before they’ll find even the first hint of food.</blockquote>\n2. What do you do there?\n2. What do you do in the library? \n2.

Birds can get badly injured in these battles, but they have to be fought if a senior bird is to establish his rank. Eventually the junior bird gives up. A new line has been drawn. They won’t need to fight again as long as it’s not over-stepped. Communication by visual signals, however, has one major limitation. In forests, sound signals will travel much further. So if a bird, in order to get enough food, needs a very large territory, it is likely to declare its territorial claims with sound.</blockquote>\n2. Why did you attend the summer camp?\n2.
