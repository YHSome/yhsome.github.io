As well as growing new talents, we also think of this stage of childhood as a time of growing upwards. But the strange thing is our growth actually slows right down.

But in eighteen twenty-three, his father got into debt. The family were locked up in Marshalsea prison, and 12-year-old Charles was sent out to work. He found himself in a blacking factory by the river Thames, putting labels on bottles of shoe polish.

Each South Pacific island has its own unique set of creatures. Surrounded by water, the ocean became embedded in their culture — sometimes in surprising ways. The size of many South Pacific islands means that food is often limited. The smaller and more isolated they are, the harder it is to survive. And in this ocean of islands, there’s one tiny island that stands out. It’s home to perhaps the most remote community of people on the planet, with a truly inspiring story. Their approach ensures a future for the next generation to enjoy.</blockquote>\n\n\n2.

He set out on a long journey to where God lived with some bread and drinks. On his way, he met an old woman. She was sitting in the park. The boy took a rest and sat beside her. He found that the woman looked hungry when he wanted to drink something. Therefore, he gave her a piece of bread. The old woman accepted the bread and gave the boy a pretty smile. They ate and smiled all afternoon without saying anything. As it began to get dark, the boy felt tired and decided to leave. But he turned around, ran back and gave the woman a hug. When he arrived home, his mother was surprised by the look of joy on his face. He then told his mother that he had had lunch with God and that she had got the most beautiful smile.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>There once was a little boy who wanted to meet God.

No wonder this little baby clings on so tightly. This really isn’t the safest place to search for breakfast. At this time of year, it’s about their only option. But this fast food is no easy meal. These lizards are a precious source of both food and water. But catching one with a baby on your back is almost impossible. Someone else has beaten them to it. The lizard is out of reach in a crack.

But you don’t need to go into the wild to find it, or even a zoo. Its natural habitat is your living room. And that animal is the dog. For over 40 years, Horizon and the BBC have been examining the nature of dogs, in a bid to better understand the intense and often complex relationship we have with them, from discovering their origins to revealing our own role in the dogs’ evolution. Scientists have tried to decipher dogs’ often puzzling behavior, and have discovered the impact of our wildly varying attitude towards them.</blockquote>\n\n\n2.

As continents shift and clash, volcanoes erupt, glaciers grow and recede, the Earth’s crust is carved in countless, fascinating ways, leaving a trail of geological mysteries behind.

But his brother told him there was no Santa Claus. He asked his mother whether it was true, and she told him not to believe what his brother said. One Christmas Eve, his mother asked him if he wanted to give anyone a present. Tom thought of his best friend Jenny who often had a cold in winter. He thought Jenny might feel better if she wore warmer clothes, so he wanted to give Jenny a coat. Then Tom went to the shop with his mother and picked a white coat. His mother helped him wrap the coat and put a card on it, which said, “To Jenny. From Santa Claus.” The next day in the early morning, Tom went to Jenny’s home and put the present at the front door. He realized that Santa Claus was really alive, and everyone was on his team.</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote>When Tom was a little child, he always looked forward to Christmas, because he would receive lots of gifts from Santa Claus.

Flowing from the heart of the continent, it has written a story across the landscape as it forges its way north, through mountain, forest, marsh and desert. For centuries its waters have sustained life in some of the harshest places on Earth. Without it, this corner of Africa would be only rock and dust and sand. Civilizations have risen and fallen on its banks. Without its gifts, the pyramids would never have been built. Mankind has looked on this river and wondered at its mysteries, where it comes from, why it floods every year, and how flowing through the desert for thousands of kilometers it never runs dry? </blockquote>\n\n\n2.

When asked why he waited that long, Sam gave his answer. When a drowning person is struggling in the water, one should not jump into the water to save him at once. If not, it is likely that both of them are dragged into the water and get drowned. So it’s better to wait for the chance until he becomes tired after struggling. It’s important to know when the best time to do the right thing is. </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Sam is an experienced sailor. One day, a young sailor suddenly fell into the water. He started screaming for help and struggling hard in the water. Just then, Sam walked to the side of the boat, observing him calmly. After struggling for a while, the young sailor became tired and began to sink. At the moment, Sam jumped into the water at once and saved him. Later, when asked why he waited that long, Sam answered that being a sailor for many years, he had learned a fact. When a drowning person is struggling in the water, one should not jump into the water right away. Otherwise, it is likely that they are dragged into the water and get drowned together. So it’s better to wait the drowning person struggling for a while. When he is tired out, it will be the best time to jump into the water to save him. It’s important to seize the chance.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Sam is an experienced sailor. He works on a boat. One day, their boat rocked violently from side to side because of a strong wind.

Modern civilisation couldn’t exist without it. But there is still only a finite amount of water to go around. In many parts of the world, scarcity has led to a bitter struggle for control over the available supply. And that’s true, in even the wealthiest countries. Today Los Angeles is a city with every luxury and convenience. Yet not so long ago at the turn of the last century, Los Angeles was struggling. LA’s problem was its location, hemmed there on three sides by desert and on the fourth by ocean. So it led to the most basic requirement for city life — a reliable water supply.</blockquote>\n\n\n2.

They transform what it feels like to be human, and to live richly and fully, creating cultures as well as communities and building civilisations. Art is history.

Tom realized he should practise more, so he practised table tennis every day after school. Several months later, he made an appointment with Jane to have a match. In the end, Tom won it. He was very happy and would never forget that day.

One day, when having a walk in the nearby park, he saw his classmate Jane playing table tennis with a boy there. The boy always lost the games. To show his excellent skills, Tom offered to play against Jane. At first, Tom’s scores were far more than Jane’s. However, Jane won the game in the end. Tom felt very ashamed. Through the match, Tom realized that Jane was a better player and that he would need more practise to beat her. Therefore, he practised table tennis every day after school for several months.

During the [15th/fifteenth] century, European sailors embarked on a new age of exploration. Cultures that previously were vast oceans apart now met for the first time. But before this became a story of conquest, plunder and empire, there was a forgotten era of discovery. And for many, this was a golden age, when curiosity, mutual respect and exchange of goods and ideas were recorded in the art of countless human encounters. These are the Benin Bronzes. Looted from Africa in the [19th/nineteenth] century, they are now recognised as one of the continent’s greatest artistic masterpieces.</blockquote>\n\n\n2.

Tom’s mom told Tom that she would use the money to pay the rent instead of buying Christmas food. In fact, Tom had been doing odd jobs to earn enough money to buy a new pair of boots. His mom didn’t know that. On Tom’s way to the shoe store, he saw a house that had Christmas lights and other decorations. Then he realized his family had no Christmas decorations, nor Christmas food. Then he began to have a sense of guilt, for he was going to buy a pair of shoes for himself while his mother was sad because she couldn’t afford anything for Christmas. It was then he knew what he should do — he should buy Christmas food for his family. He bought a turkey, some ham and some other Christmas treats in a grocery.

Ants use their antennae to detect food. This is fuel for the colony. Within minutes, fellow workers are by her side, having followed a trail of chemicals that she has deliberately left behind her. The ants must work fast. Down here, exhaust fumes can create a thick toxic smog. Now they must take the long road home, back to the rest of the colony. As the first worker ants reach the safety of the underground colony, city life is about to come crashing in on their world. </blockquote>\n\n\n2.

There are moons with giant volcanoes, moons with vast oceans sealed under thick ice. And now we know a few are rich in organic compounds. In the right combination they might even support life. At first glance, moons don’t look ideal for life. Take Enceladus, it’s a shiny ball of ice, [300/three hundred] miles across, orbiting Saturn. In [2005/two thousand five], the Cassini probes spotted ice volcanoes erupting from the surface of Enceladus. That meant there had to be heat under all that ice, heat that created oceans of water.

It was dangerous at night, so the owner answered the door with her gun. When she opened the door, she saw a person turning round and walking away. The owner cried, “Freeze!” But the man went on walking. The owner thought he was trying to escape, so she shot him dead. The dead man turned out to be a Japanese exchange student. He went to visit a friend but could not remember the number of the house. When he realized he had gone to the wrong house, he turned round to leave. He didn’t understand the command “Freeze!” In the United States, people usually use it when they are ready to use the gun, and if the person moves, they will shoot.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>In Los Angeles, somebody rang the doorbell of a house one evening. The place was dangerous at night, so the owner of the house took the gun with her to answer the door. She saw a person when she opened the door. The person turned around and began to walk away. Seeing this, the owner said, “Freeze!” But the man didn’t stop. The owner believed he wanted to escape, so she shot him dead. Later, a sad story was discovered. The dead man was an exchange student from Japan. He was looking for his friend’s house, but he didn’t remember its number. When he found he had arrived at the wrong house, he decided to leave. He didn’t know much English and could not understand the word “freeze”. Actually it means “stand still and don’t move”. In America, people usually use “Freeze!” when they are ready to shoot. And they will do that if the person doesn’t obey this command.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>One evening, someone rang the doorbell of a house in Los Angeles.

These distances proved a great challenge for animal castaways, but when they found new land, many evolved into new species. Human colonisers followed similar routes, and the ocean that isolated them from the rest of the world became central to their culture.\n\n三问五答：\nM: Hey, Mary.

The driver explained that there were so many people full of anger and disappointment, so Tom didn't have to take it personally.

The only thing that made her happy was a dozen red roses from her boyfriend. As she was cleaning up, a young tired-looking woman came into her room with her son. Nervously, she explained that her husband who was a prisoner was the next patient. She begged Mary to let him sit in the waiting room with her, as long as possible before sending him back to prison. Mary agreed as it was Christmas Eve and she just wanted to help. After the woman’s husband came, the family enjoyed the time together for over half an hour. At the end of the visit, the man felt sad because he couldn’t give his wife a Christmas gift. On hearing this, Mary handed the roses to the surprised man who presented them to his wife.</blockquote>\n93. \n93. <blockquote>It was the afternoon of December [24/the twenty-fourth], the day before Christmas.

Invoking the gods in their prayers, the wise man could work cures or see the future. But because they didn't want these magical powers to fall into enemy hands, they never left anything written down and tried to keep all their knowledge secret. Because of this, we know very little about them. We, in modern times, sometimes imagine them as tall, thin men with long, white beards. These wise men were called “Druids”, and were very respected. Tribal chiefs always asked them for advice before making a decision. The Druids knew about the healing powers of forest plants.</blockquote>\n2. Will you throw away the old toothbrush right away?\n2.

One evening, he was walking along a road. He kept looking up at the stars and thought the end of the world was near. Lost in his thoughts, he kept walking without looking down. Suddenly, he fell into a small pond, but he couldn’t swim. He tried hard to get out but failed, so he screamed for help. Hearing his screams, the villages came to help him. One villager told Tom that he pretended to read the future in the stars, but he failed to see what was at his feet. We should pay more attention to what is in front of us and let the future take care of itself.</blockquote>\n334. \n334. <blockquote>Tom was a fortune teller.

They came from the kingdoms of the Europe in the Middle Ages. Thirsting after conquest, trade and wealth, they exported their civilization from their little corner of Western Europe to every corner of the world. Before long, Western civilization became the world’s dominant civilization. The West taught the rest its way of doing business, its scientific method, its law and its politics, its way of dressing, of speaking, and of praying.

He found the water very sweet and decided to let his teacher enjoy the water. He filled his leather canteen with the water. After a three-day journey, he presented the water to his teacher. The teacher took a deep drink and thanked his student. Tom went home happily. Then another student found the water was actually awful. He didn’t understand why his teacher pretended to like it. The teacher explained that the water was a gift of love and kindness and nothing could be sweeter than that.</blockquote>\n185. \n185. <blockquote>Tom was kind-hearted and respected his teacher very much.

Well aware of the danger, they stay in the deep water as long as they can, but they can only hold their breath for about 20 minutes. Catching a four-metre-long whale that weighs one tonne is no easy task, even if that whale is weakened by starvation. Day by day, as the hole gets bigger, it becomes increasingly difficult for the bear to land a whale. It may have taken a long time and a lot of patience, but a catch when it’s made brings abundant rewards.</blockquote>\n2. Are dancing and music what she’s interested in?\n2.

It lets us enjoy a wonderful range of foods, limited only by the preferences we’re born with, and the occasional dish that poisons us. It takes us right to the edge of what’s safe to eat. And there’s one food above all others that shows just how far we’re willing to push those limits. We’ve come to a hot chili-eating competition in the American Mid West, to find out just how far the human sense of taste can go. Keeping watch in the audience is Professor Paul Jones, who’s spent years studying why we keep coming back for the burn.</blockquote>\n2. How do you prepare for the dancing contest?\n2.

Her father took her to the kitchen. He put potatoes and eggs separately in two pots and boiled them in water. The daughter waited impatiently, wondering what he was doing. After 20 minutes, the father finished cooking and took the food out. He asked his daughter to see and touch the potatoes and eggs. The daughter was still puzzled. The father explained that both the potatoes and eggs had faced the same difficulty but they reacted differently. The strong and hard potato became soft and weak while the egg with only a thin shell became hard. The father asked his daughter again when she faced difficulty, how she would respond.

Only a young woman and her two baby daughters were unhurt. It was winter, and the ground was covered in thick snow. When it grew dark, the woman turned a suitcase into a bed and put the children inside. She covered them with all the clothes she could find to keep them warm. During the night, it got terribly cold. The woman kept as near as she could to the children. Early the next morning, she heard planes passing overhead so she sent a signal by stamping out the letters “SOS” in the snow. Thankfully, a pilot saw the signal and sent a message to the nearest town. Soon after, a helicopter arrived and rescued the mother and her children.</blockquote>\n288. \n288. <blockquote>A few years ago, a plane crashed in the mountains. The pilot was dead. And the only survivors were a young woman and her two babies. It was winter, and the ground was covered with thick snow. The woman knew that the nearest village was miles away, so there would be no rescue until the next morning. When it grew dark, the woman put her babies in a suitcase and covered them with all the clothes she could find to keep them warm. At night, it was so cold that the woman stayed as close to her children as possible and even tried to get into the suitcase, but it was too small. Early the next morning, she heard planes passing overhead and wondered how she could send a signal. Then she stamped out the letters “SOS” in the snow. Luckily, a pilot saw the signal and sent a message by radio to the nearest town. Soon after, a helicopter arrived and rescued the woman and her babies.</blockquote>\n288. \n288. <blockquote>Some years ago, a plane crashed in the mountains and killed its pilot. Unbelievably, the plane’s only passengers, a young woman and her two children, didn’t get hurt. It was in the middle of winter, and the ground was covered in thick snow. The woman knew that the nearest village was far away, so no one would come to rescue them until the next morning. When it got dark, she turned a suitcase into a bed and put her children inside, covering them with clothes to keep them warm. During the night, it became very cold. The woman kept as near to the children as she could. She even tried to get into the suitcase herself, but it was too small. Early the next morning, she heard planes overhead and wondered how to send a signal. Then she had an idea. Using her feet, she stamped out the letters “SOS” in the snow. Fortunately, a pilot saw the signal and sent a message by radio to the nearest town. Soon after, a helicopter arrived on the scene to rescue the woman and her children.</blockquote>\n#####题目名称: 考前冲刺17\n1. <blockquote>For centuries, travelers to China have told tales of magical landscapes and surprising creatures.

He often felt worried, until one night he thought of a plan. The next morning, he found a large wooden box, filled it, locked it up and put it in the kitchen. The next time his sons came to have dinner, they noticed the box and asked what was inside. The old man answered there were just some things he’d been saving. His sons thought the box must be full of gold. They decided to protect the treasure and take turns living with their old father. Several years later, the old father died. After the funeral, the sons found the key to the box. When they unlocked it, they found it full of stones. They poured all the stones out and then saw a note on the bottom: Thanks for your company, my sons.</blockquote>\n167. \n167. <blockquote>Once there was an old tailor who lived on his own in a small town. His three sons seldom came to see him. Not many customers came to his store, so when he grew old, he didn’t have much money. He was worried about himself before he worked out a plan. The next morning, he found a large wooden box, filled it, locked it up and put it in his kitchen. The next time his sons came to have dinner with him, they noticed the box and wondered what was inside. The old man said just some things he had saved were in it. The sons considered there must be a lot of gold in the box. They made up their minds that they had to protect the big wealth and took turns living with their old father. A few years passed. The old father died. When the funeral finished, the sons found the key to the box. They unlocked the box and saw some stones in it. They poured them out. Then the three brothers looked inside only to see a message on the bottom: Thank you, sons, for your company.</blockquote>\n167. \n167. <blockquote>An old tailor lived by himself in a small town. He had three sons but they didn’t often come to see him. Very few people came to his store, so when he was old, he didn’t have much wealth left. The tailor usually felt worried about himself. He came up with a plan one night. The next morning, he found a big wooden box, filled it, locked it and put it in his kitchen. When his sons came for dinner the next time, they saw the box and asked what was in it. The old man said there was nothing but some things he had been saving over the years. The sons thought it must be filled with all the gold their father had saved. They made a decision that they should live with their old father in turn to protect the treasure. After several years, the old father passed away. When the funeral was over, the sons searched the house for the key to the box. They opened the box but found lots of stones in it. They poured all the stones out. Then the three brothers stared inside and saw a note on the bottom.

Right now, while the sun is low, there’s no immediate cause for concern. But this situation won’t last long. Australia is the world’s most arid continent with blistering daytime temperatures. Every hour, the temperature rises by five degrees centigrade. Soon the heat will reach a critical point. Any kangaroo out in the open is in serious danger of overheating. In the full sun, the temperature on the ground soars to [70/seventy] degrees. By midday, the radiation is so intense they must take shelter.</blockquote>\n2.

I love you!” Only then did David realize that Kate mistook the lipstick for a crayon and drew a picture with it for her mom. Looking into Kate’s tearful eyes, David realized that he was wrong. He should not have blamed his little daughter without asking the reason.</blockquote>\n#####题目名称: 考前冲刺20\n1. <blockquote>When the English first arrived in America, the hardships they faced were totally unexpected. Had it not been for some friendly Indians, they would never have survived. They knew nothing about planting crops, hunting animals, building grass houses, or making clothing from animal skins. Life in England had been much easier. The settlers were taught to build canoes and make snowshoes. The Indians also showed them how to burn trails through the forest, hunt large animals and trap smaller ones, and spear fish. The natives also introduced to the settlers typical foods such as turkey and corn. Everything possible was done to make their new settlement similar to the homes they had left behind. </blockquote>\n2. What do farmers use to grow organic foods?\n2.

But they had forgotten one thing. It was sunny as Kate’s father drove them to the forest. They found a nice spot near the river and put up their tents. After swimming, they felt hungry, so they decided to cook dinner. But first they needed a fire! It was then that they realized they had no matches. Everyone followed Kate through the forest. Finally, they reached an old house and knocked at the door. An old woman opened it. After hearing their problem, the old woman warmly asked them to stay there that night. She cooked them a delicious meal. Then they lay down next to the fire in their sleeping bags and enjoyed a comfortable night. </blockquote>\n268. \n268. <blockquote>It was summer.

At first sight, you might take it for some romantic castle from the middle-ages, but it’s nothing of the kind. It’s a war memorial. It represents the military might of the state of Prussia and Prussia’s determination to create a greater Germany. For a thousand years and more, Germany had been weak, divided, an easy target for foreign invaders. This monument declares that under Prussian leadership, and with Prussian technology, that will never happen again. “Let us arm, let us fight, let us unite.” “Let us build a great military machine.”</blockquote>\n2.

He was going to Europe on business and needed to borrow [5,000/five thousand] dollars. The bank would need security for the loan. The businessman handed over the key to his car. The bank agreed to accept it as a guarantee for the loan. An employee drove it into the bank’s garage and parked it there. The businessman returned and repaid the five thousand dollars and the interest. The loan officer said they checked the businessman out and found the businessman was a billionaire. They were puzzled why the businessman bothered to borrow the money.

An employee drove it into the bank’s underground garage and parked it there. Two weeks later, the businessman returned, and repaid the load, [5,000/five thousand] dollars and the interest on the load, [15.41 dollars/fifteen dollars and forty-one cents]. The loan officer said they were confused. The bank checked him out and found that he was a billionaire. They wondered why the businessman borrowed the money.

He said he was going to Europe on business for two weeks and needed to borrow [5,000/five thousand] dollars. The bank officer told him that the bank would need some kind of security for such a loan. So the businessman handed over the key to a very expensive car which was parked on the street in front of the bank. After checking that the car did indeed belong to the businessman, the bank agreed to accept it as a guarantee for the loan. An employee drove the car into the bank’s garage and parked it there. Two weeks later, the businessman returned, and repaid the 5,000 dollars and the interest, which came to [15.41 dollars/fifteen dollars and forty-one cents]. The loan officer said they were a little confused. When the businessman was away, they checked the businessman out and found he was a billionaire. They were puzzled why the businessman bothered to borrow the money. The businessman answered that in San Francisco there was no other place where he could park his car for two weeks for 15 dollars. </blockquote>\n206. \n#####题目名称: 考前冲刺22\n1. <blockquote>High in the Bale Mountains of Africa, lives an unlikely looking creature which seems to have lost all sense of self preservation.

While his father was eating, he dropped food on his clothes. Others in the restaurant watched the old father in an unpleasant way, but Tom didn’t mind it at all. After his father finished eating, Tom quietly took him to the wash room and made his clothes look clean again. When Tom and his father came out, other people in the restaurant were watching them in dead silence. Tom didn’t feel embarrassed at all.

The Dartford warbler looks quite different to any other small birds that you’ll see in Wales. The view doesn’t matter. What’s more important is that he’s found in a small patch where he can sing and nest. But he’ll have to sing very loud above the traffic noise, and this is something all urban birds have to get used to. This is a city in North Wales. It’s early morning and the traffic is very busy.

There is a complete network of bicycle lanes citywide. They have the bicycle lanes next to the sidewalks. Sidewalks are the slow traffic. The bike lanes are a little bit faster, and then there would be parked cars, and then there would be the traffic. In this way you have the parked cars to protect the bicyclists. It helps invite a lot of people who would be too afraid to bicycle to get the idea that “I can actually do it also, because now it is much safer.” </blockquote>\n2. What do you like doing?\n2.

So Rene doesn’t do the cleaning, the dishes or the laundry. She sits on the sofa watching TV every evening. After two weeks, the house is filled with dirty dishes and clothes. And the garbage cans are full. One day, Rene gets home from work. She is surprised to find the kitchen becomes clean. The next day, the living room is clean, and the children are washing their clothes. Rene says she will do the housework again, but her children have to help her. Now Rene does the housework with her three children. After that, they all sit on the sofa and watch TV.</blockquote>\n118. \n118. <blockquote>When Rene comes home from work at five o’clock, she walks into the living room and looks at her three children. They are watching TV. The living room is a mess. There are empty glasses and dirty socks on the floor. There are cookies on the sofa. Games and toys are everywhere. Rene is angry. She tells her children, “I can’t work all day and then do the housework all evening. I’m not going to do the housework.” And so, Rene doesn’t do the housework. Every evening, she sits on the sofa and watches TV. After two weeks, every plate, fork and glass in the house is dirty. All the children’s clothes are dirty; every garbage can is full. The house is a mess. Then one day, Rene comes home from work and gets a big surprise — the kitchen is clean. The next day, the living room is clean, and the children are washing their clothes. Rene tells her children, “OK. I’ll do the housework again, but you have to help me.” Now Rene and her three children do the housework together.

After searching for some days in vain, they made wishes to God. At first, they wished for food, and the next morning Tom saw a tree with apples, but Mary got nothing. Then, Tom wished for clothes and a house, and he got all of them the next day, but Mary still had nothing. Finally, Tom wished for a ship, and again he found a ship. He boarded the ship and decided to leave Mary on the island. When he was about to leave, a voice from heaven asked him why he left his friend on the island. Tom said Mary deserved nothing because God had ignored all her wishes. The voice told him that Mary had wished that all his wishes would come true.</blockquote>\n213. \n213. <blockquote>After surviving a ship accident, Tom and Mary swam to a small island and started to explore the island separately.

At last, Tom wished for a ship to help him leave the island. The next morning, he saw a ship. He got on the ship and decided to leave alone.

Again, all these things were given to him the following day, but his friend still had nothing. Finally, he wished for a ship, so that he could leave the place. The next day, he saw a ship on the shore. He boarded the ship and decided to leave without Mary. Just as he was going to leave, a voice from heaven asked him why he didn’t take Mary with him.

And what’s more, they throw light on some of the great mysteries of evolution. Why have the birds of paradise become the most diverse, bizarre and beautiful of all bird families? Why have they developed the most extravagant plumes and adornments of any group of living things on Earth, so that sometimes, they almost cease to look like birds at all? And why is it that this extraordinary family is largely restricted to one jungle-covered island in the Pacific?</blockquote>\n2. What’s the Student Union responsible for?\n2.

He and his parents were happy, but they were also worried about the high tuition fee. To make enough money for Steve to go to college, Steve’s parents worked very hard. Steve also got himself a job in the local clothes factory. He was polite, hard-working and did his work well. After two months, the family found that they still hadn’t made enough money. On his last day working in the factory, Steve made some mistakes and then was asked to go to Mr. Wilson’s office. He was worried that Mr. Wilson would blame him. However, Mr. Wilson just wanted to help him and gave him two thousand dollars in addition to his wage.

But the loss of sea ice isn’t just an issue for the Arctic, because the state of the ice affects the climate of the whole planet. Because it’s white, the ice reflects up to [90%/ninety percent] of the Sun’s energy. This is called the albedo effect and it’s why we often see heat haze in the Arctic. Because sea water is dark, it absorbs most of the Sun’s heat. In the Arctic, this can trigger a chain reaction, as the warming water melts more ice, exposing more water to the Sun’s heat.</blockquote>\n2. What are your main duties in the gallery?\n2.

For Russian hamsters, it’s all about running. In nature, they cover six miles a night. They can cover the same distance by running on the spot. And it seems they do it for fun! When scientists placed a wheel in the wild, mice took to it just as keenly as this enthusiastic hamster. Like human athletes, exercise creates a rush of endorphins. He experiences a runner’s high. At full speed, he reaches [600/six hundred] strides a minute — four times more than the fastest racehorse. Moving X-ray shows that, unlike horses, even when flat out he always keeps one foot on the ground. </blockquote>\n2. What are plastic bags made of?\n2. What are plastic bags made from?\n2.

However, up until now, we have only found [160,000/a hundred and sixty thousand] tons worldwide, enough to fit comfortably inside a [4-bedroom/four-bedroom] house. Physicists have discovered that this special metal was created in outer space long before our planet existed. Over 5 billion years ago, gold and other heavy-metal atoms formed in a giant dying star. As it exploded, shock waves blasted minute gold particles across the universe at 70 million miles per hour, scattering them far and wide throughout the early solar system. As this cloud of rubble compacted together, the gold became trapped inside the rocks of the newly forming planet Earth.</blockquote>\n2. When was the first car invented?\n2.

They won’t need to fight again as long as it’s not over-stepped. Communication by visual signals, however, has one major limitation. In forests, sound signals will travel much further.

The manager of the coffee house quickly closed all the doors and telephoned the police. The policemen soon came. They searched everyone and the coffee house, but they didn’t find the necklace.

Over [60%/sixty percent] of the world’s fish catch comes from the Pacific. But like all oceans, it has little or no protection, so it may not stay healthy much longer. For the South Pacific, this is a critical time. It’s changing in ways that, if left unchecked, could develop into a global crisis. Some of its residents have been through crisis before. And protecting the fish will ensure a healthy ocean for all the marine life of the Pacific. It will require international commitment and co-operation.</blockquote>\n2.

They had a dog called Jacky. They loved the dog but could not take him abroad with them. They left the dog in a pet shop before they left for their holiday. About one month later, they came back from holiday. Mr. Brown drove his car to get the dog. When Mr. Brown reached home, he told his wife that Jacky hadn’t enjoyed the stay at the pet shop. Jacky barked all the way home as if he wanted to tell Mr. Brown something. Mrs. Brown looked at the dog and answered that the dog was certainly trying to tell Mr. Brown something. The dog tried to say that Mr. Brown had taken the wrong dog home. </blockquote> \n149. \n149. <blockquote>Mr. and Mrs. Brown were going abroad for their holiday. They had a dog called Jacky.

And we have gone to great lengths to get it to where we want it to be. Water, the giver of life, essential to all and forever sacred. </blockquote>\n2. Why can’t I drive with friends?\n2.

He spent most of his spare time learning to cook. He would not give up trying a recipe until he got it right. Now, after five years of practice, Tom is famous as a cook in his hometown, and uses his cooking skills to raise money for other children suffering from the same rare disease. He has raised more than [100,000/one hundred thousand] dollars. He even has his own cook book, which includes more than [60/sixty] recipes for simple food. “Besides watching TV cartoons, children can also learn to cook by themselves,” said Tom.</blockquote>\n#####题目名称: 2012广东C\n1. <blockquote>Much of my work here is to show people the diversity of the wildlife and to explain its biology. It’s important to get to know sharks. With gray sharks there is tension. They’ll eat almost anything. You know, humans are much more dangerous to sharks than they are to us. When you spend time with sharks, you begin to understand them and learn to respect them. But you have to command their respect too. They’re a vital link in the chain of life. Like wolves they weed out the sick and the injured.</blockquote>\n2. What’s the book’s problem?\n2. What’s the problem with this book?\n2. What is the problem with the book?\n2.

Since earliest times gold has been adored and treasured by man. A symbol of enduring value, gold has been used as a currency for centuries. In [1847/eighteen forty-seven] one man found gold in the bed of a Californian river. And so began the Californian Gold Rush. Men came in their thousands and the city that we now know as San Francisco was born. Today most of the world’s gold is found, not in rivers, but deep within the earth.

Yet its story is one of the least understood. But what is now the site of a splendid palace was once open countryside. As royal residences go, Buckingham Palace is something of a newcomer. The staterooms are less than [200/two hundred] years old. Yet its history is much older and more dramatic than you might think. Its rooms are filled with objects that are clues to the character of kings and queens past. And the art and architecture combine to make a statement about Britain’s place in the world. </blockquote>\n2. What role will the Internet play in the future classroom?\n2.

Every time he delivered a letter to Mrs. Brown, he had to finish his work quite late because she lived far away. However, Mrs. Brown always kindly invited him in for a drink, so Tom did not mind this. When Tom entered the gate of Mrs. Brown’s house yesterday, he didn’t see her working in the garden. He was surprised because she usually spent afternoons there when the weather was fine. So Tom went to the back of the house to check if she was in the kitchen. But he found the door locked. He returned to the front of the house and knocked hard on the door but there was no answer. It was very strange, because Mrs. Brown seldom left the house. Tom noticed Mrs. Brown had not taken in her milk at the door so perhaps she was ill. Tom walked around the house, found an open window and went inside.

E equals MC squared is the symbol of Einstein’s genius. It’s an equation that sums up one of the most powerful truths about the universe. It combines two ideas, which until Einstein came along, no one had ever dreamed could be connected in such a powerful way. The idea of mass and the idea of energy. </blockquote>\n2.

What a picture adds to a story, and what the words leave out, is key. But how exactly does that relationship work? Although there were illustrated books for adults, by far the majority were for children. One stands out above all others—Alice in Wonderland.

I guess it’s really how my interest in bears started. To me, bears, more than any other creature, represent wilderness. And more than that — wildness itself. Brown bears once roamed across Europe and North America but today they’re found in just a few small pockets of really wild land. Alaska is one of the bears’ last strongholds. In most places, bears keep a healthy distance from each other but these bears have somehow learned to live with one another. Left alone, it has become a city of bears.</blockquote>\n2.

It’s an extremely, extremely difficult question to answer. Because if you think about it, wherever you look around you, there always seems to be something there.

What, then, exists inside the space in the box? Is it really nothing? You might wonder why this matters. It’s about reality at the very furthest reaches of human perception, a place where the deepest mysteries of the universe may be held. </blockquote>\n2.

Because of a quirk of nature, grasses and trees have a different way of turning sunlight into food. When they die, they leave slightly different forms of carbon in the earth. And the main force behind these cycles is the climate. As geological time gave way to historical time, the human influence over the environment moved into a new phase. </blockquote>\n2.

Tom was having dinner near a corner in a small restaurant when an old woman entered. She was carrying a basket of flowers in her hands. She was in rags and looked very tired. She asked if anyone needed flowers for one dollar each one by one. But none of them bothered to buy any flowers from her. She walked to the corner and sat down at the empty table next to Tom disappointedly. Only finding a few coins in her pocket, she ordered a bowl of soup. She looked at her flowers, murmuring that she hadn’t sold any flowers for the whole day. After hearing this, Tom stood up and walked to her. He picked out two flowers and then handed the old woman a fifty-dollar note. The woman told Tom that she didn’t have enough change. But Tom replied to her that the flower was a Christmas gift for her. </blockquote>\n216. \n216. <blockquote>It was a rainy and cold Christmas Eve.

The wet seasons bring downpours, but not to everywhere at once. These isolated rains mean that some animals have to run for thousands of miles in search of freshly grown grass. Grass, unlike other plants, grows from its roots instead of the tip. It means it can be almost constantly cropped — a never-ending supply of food. And as grass makes up over [50%/fifty percent] of an elephant’s diet, it’s in their own interests to clear the trees and maintain space for grass to grow. </blockquote>\n2.

But how London came to look the way it does can also be seen from above. Because [60/sixty] years ago, the Royal Air Force photographed the whole of London from end to end, and left us a unique record of a city torn apart by war. Now exactly the same process is being repeated. And by directly comparing London then with London now, we can tell the story of the greatest transformation in the city’s history. It’s a transformation that continues faster now than at any time since the war.</blockquote>\n2. How do you like wearing school uniforms?\n2. What do you think of wearing school uniforms?\n2.

The waitress Mary came to him with the coffee he ordered, but spilled some coffee on his new jacket. The coffee stain seemed impossible to wash off. Mary felt sorry and asked Tom to leave the jacket with her. The next day, the jacket was sent back and Tom found the stain had disappeared. He had been working on a new washing powder for years but couldn’t make it. Tom went to ask Mary how she did it. Mary pointed to some purple flowers and said it was a special method passed on from her grandma. Tom thanked Mary and took a purple flower to study.

The name of the river is probably a Scottish word which means “broad river”. The Thames rises in southwest England and flows east for a distance of 338 kilometres to London. On the north bank stands the Tower of London, which was once home to the royal family and later served as a prison. The Thames River is crowded at its mouth with the busy ships of England’s commerce, but the upper course of the river is known for its quiet beauty. Someone once said the Thames was the finest river in the world “because it runs liquid history”. </blockquote>\n2. Is it fun to keep a pet dog?\n2. Is it fun to keep a dog as pet?\n2.

At that time, England was ruled by a cruel king whose name is John. John and his men would soon be arriving. The villagers worried the king would demand food and housing. So they decided to act like fools. When the king arrived, he saw a man riding a donkey. The man had a heavy bag on his own shoulders, and looked rather tired. The king asked why not put the bag on the donkey’s back. And the man answered that he decided to lighten the donkey’s burden by carrying the bag himself.

A yellow dog walked up to John. John was shocked when he heard the dog talk. The dog told him that he had learned to talk when he was young. The dog said that he had joined the army. His job was to find out enemy secrets. There he had been very successful and won many awards. After eight years, he had decided to retire. John decided to buy the dog. When John asked the owner how much he wanted for the dog, the owner said the dog was a liar so he was sold for 10 dollars. </blockquote>\n215. \n215. <blockquote>John saw a sign “Talking dog for sale” on an old farmhouse while driving along a country road.

Towns like Livermore disappeared as quickly as they had been formed. Slowly, the trees of New England grew around the ruins and reclaimed the land. This new forest was very different. By chopping down the old-growth trees, people had given fast-growing maples and oaks a chance to claim the land. They grew back in greater numbers than ever before.</blockquote>\n2.

Our own family is often our best guide to what it will mean. When we imagine our older age, a lot of us look at our parents. We know we’ve inherited their genes and suspect that what’s happening to them now may well be what happens to us in the future. And that’s something we’re likely to have mixed feelings about. Because we inherit our parents’ genes, we might also be vulnerable to some of the same illnesses. Our skin cells simply can’t replace themselves as well as they did.

Black holes are the most terrifying places in the universe. Created when a giant star dies, at their dark hearts is a point of infinite gravity. So powerful, nothing can escape it, not even light. Black holes, instead of lasting forever, as everyone thought, eventually disappear, leaving no trace of anything, including information. Every black hole has a boundary. It’s the point of no return. If anything passes the boundary, it takes its information with it. </blockquote>\n2. Why do parents think it is a problem?\n2. Why do parents think it’s a problem?\n2.

Beyond the words, lies a fascinating world of nonverbal communication. A walk to convey power, a greeting that gets the upper hand, a gesture that can hide a lie, body language can betray us.

One day he gathered all the workers and announced that the factory would no longer make electric fans. Instead, they would make paper fans. The factory would need more workers and some artists as well. To people’s surprise, young Mr. Lee’s changes were a great success. Their paper fans became famous for the great beauty and high quality.

During his first two years in middle school, he found science very difficult and his school reports were terrible. Therefore, he left the school and began to work at the supermarket at the age of [16/sixteen]. One evening he saw a documentary about the famous scientist, Albert Einstein. From the show, John knew that Einstein did not do very well at school and often failed Maths but he got success. Therefore, John thought he had a chance too. So he decided to go to evening classes after work. He studied for two years. After he finished his high school studies, he was accepted by Cambridge University. During his time at university, he worked hard and he was happy to study medicine. Thanks to his effort, he came top of his class. Sometimes, he wanted to write a letter to the reporter from the Einstein show to say thanks because he learned to follow his dream from the show. </blockquote>\n106. \n106. <blockquote>John Smith is [32/thirty two] years old now.

The woman asked whether it had noticed there were flowers on its side of the path. She had always known about its crack, so she planted flower seeds on its side of the path. While they walked back, the cracked pot watered them. The woman could then pick the beautiful flowers to decorate the table.

The perfect pot was proud of itself, while the cracked one felt ashamed. One day, it spoke to the woman and said it was ashamed because the crack caused water to leak out. The woman asked if it had noticed that there were flowers on its side of the road but not on the other side. In fact, she had already noticed the crack, so she had planted flower seeds on the cracked pot’s side of the road. The pot helped water the seeds on their way back home, so the woman had been able to pick beautiful flowers to decorate her table.

One day, it said to the woman: “I’m ashamed of myself, because this crack caused water to leak out.” The woman smiled, “Did you notice that there are flowers on your side of the path but not on the other pot’s side?” Actually, she had always known about the crack. She planted some flower seeds on its side of the path. Every day while they walked back, the water that leaked out watered the flower seeds.

At the end of the long walk, the cracked pot arrived only half full. For two years, this went on daily, with the woman bringing home only one and a half pots of water. The perfect pot was proud of its achievement, but the poor cracked pot was ashamed.

When westerners first discovered Chinese paintings like this one, they could not see their value. To understand painting, you need to understand calligraphy. The character is not a picture of an object in the real world, but a symbol for an idea. As Chinese characters are symbols for ideas, so elements in a Chinese landscape, rocks, water, trees and mountains, became symbols of concepts. For the Chinese, pictures painted with a brush are symbols that carry both the surface meaning and additional hidden meanings. Chinese paintings are not just pretty pictures. They mean something.</blockquote>\n2. How can sleep affect students?\n2. How are students influenced by sleep?\n2. How does sleep have an influence on students?\n2.

There was a lot of money, some bank cards and an ID card in it. Mary was excited because she could use the money to buy the doll. She walked back to the store quickly and picked up the doll. At this moment, she got a call from her grandma and her heart filled with love. She looked at the wallet again. The smile of the ID card owner reminded her of Grandma. Mary felt ashamed. Then, she decided to put down the doll and ran to the address on the ID card. The woman was so happy that she cried when she got back her wallet. </blockquote>\n105. \n105. <blockquote>Mary stared at the doll in the shop window. It was advertised for the Christmas season.

Although this phenomenon was in Europe as early as 1910, it’s only recently that we’ve learned to manipulate the viruses, so that we can use them to treat cancer safely. When the virus finds cancer, it enters the cell, and turns itself into a virus factory, until the cancer cell explodes. The patient’s own system then takes over and eradicates the exploded cancer cell. Thanks to recent scientific breakthroughs, agents that have killed us for thousands of years, are now actually being used to save lives. </blockquote>\n2. How should I deal with the topic?\n2.

Flowers have just one role: to enable the plant to produce offspring. Color, perfume, nectar and shape all act to make a flower irresistible. Sunflowers grow to face the rising sun. The warmth of the rays speeds the production of nectar and this lures pollinators. One after another, hundreds of individual florets produce pollen-covered stamens. And like most flowers, sunflowers establish a close relationship with animals in order to ensure their reproduction. As these bees busily feed on nectar, they unwittingly brush against the stamens, collecting pollen and then carry it from flower to flower.</blockquote>\n2.

Alex went outside and saw the dog barking at a bush. As he was walking towards the bush, he saw something move. He pushed the branches aside. A little man stood there in a silver spacesuit. He had a big round head with green skin and a nose shaped like a carrot. He asked Alex not to hurt him. Alex said OK. Then he got to know that the man’s name was Aki and he came from another planet. His spaceship was out of fuel, so he needed help. Aki took a bottle from the pocket of his spacesuit. It had pink liquid inside. He gave the bottle to Alex. Alex opened the top, smelled and found it was lemonade.

In that small act of sharing, they reveal something that really does lie at the heart of what it is to be human. It’s a tiny but profound difference between us and the other apes, and it’s a way of thinking that underpins our ability to co-operate and create human culture. </blockquote>\n2.

When he was about to enter the shop, he saw a crying girl on the roadside, who had no money to buy a rose. So Tom bought some flowers for his mother and a rose for the little girl. Then Tom wanted to send the girl home, but she said she needed to go to the bus station because her mother worked in another town. She must give the rose to her mother today. Tom was touched and changed his mind. After driving the girl to the bus station, he went back to the shop and canceled the delivery service. He bought a larger bunch of flowers and a box of chocolates. He decided to give them to his mother in person.</blockquote>\n84. \n84. <blockquote>It was Mother’s Day, so Tom wanted to give his mom some flowers. He drove to a flower shop.

Then he noticed that one bedroom window was open. He found a big stone and pushed it under the window. He managed to climb up the window with the help of the stone.

He soon found the key David gave him couldn’t unlock neither the front door nor the back door. Jim was worried. Then he noticed that one bedroom window was open. He found a big stone and pushed it under the window. Because the stone was very heavy, he made much noise. But in the end, he managed to climb up the window with the help of the stone. Jim just had one leg inside the bedroom when he suddenly realized that someone was shining a torch up at him.

The sea floor was covered in many species, many now extinct. Just as scientists had imagined, when some of these creatures died, they were preserved intact. Their shells then became buried in the sediments at the bottom of the sea, and preserved as fossils when the sediment turned to rock. But what could these fossils reveal about the formation of the Alps? Again, it was the scientists’ exceptional powers of observation that helped solve the mystery. They noticed that the spectacular fossil-bearing rock, known as limestone, was laid down in layers several thousand feet deep. </blockquote>\n2.

One of them escaped and flew to the home of a farmer, who spoke to him with kindness and love. The other was put in a cage in the hunter’s hut and was badly treated. About a year later, a traveler was resting outside the hunter’s hut. The parrot screamed at him and threatened to kill him if he didn’t leave. Scared, the traveler went away. Later, he got to the house of the farmer and was welcomed by the other parrot. Surprised and relieved, the traveler told the parrot about his earlier experience. The parrot said that good company helped him learn the language of love, while bad company made his brother learn the language of hate. How they were treated decided who they would be.</blockquote>\n181. \n181. <blockquote>One day, a hunter caught two young parrots from their nest. One of them escaped to a kind old farmer’s home. The farmer treated him with kindness and love. While the other parrot was kept in a cage by the hunter. He was treated badly and shouted at every day. After about a year, a traveler was having a rest outside the hunter’s home. The parrot sensed him. He called him a fool and shouted that he would kill him if he didn’t leave at once. The traveler was frightened so he left. Later, he went to the farmer’s home. The other parrot welcomed him and asked him to take a rest. The traveler was surprised and relieved. He told the parrot how he was treated by the other parrot. The parrot told him that he lived with a kind man, so he learned the language of love. But the other parrot was treated badly by the hunter, so he learned the language of hate.

One parrot managed to escape and flew to the home of a kind old farmer, who talked to him with love and kindness. However, the other parrot was put into a cage in the hunter’s hut, where he was screamed at and treated badly every day. Around a year later, a traveler was taking a rest outside the hunter’s hut. The parrot noticed him and screamed, “Fool! Why are you here? Leave or I’ll kill you!” The traveler was so scared that he went away. Then he reached the farmer’s home, where the other parrot lived. The bird welcomed him and said politely, “Please sit in the yard and take a rest.” The traveler felt very surprised and relieved, so he told the parrot about his earlier experience and asked the parrot why he was so kind. The parrot replied that the other parrot must be his brother. He said he was lucky enough to live with a kind man, while his brother was raised by a cruel hunter. He learned the language of love but his brother learned the language of hate. Who they would be was determined by how they were treated.</blockquote>\n#####题目名称: 2020广一模C\n1. <blockquote>China announced the Outline Development Plan for the Greater Bay Area on February 18.

In his imagination, as he reaches the speed of light, the hands of the clock appear frozen in time. Einstein knows that back at the clock tower, time is passing normally. But on Einstein’s light-speed bus, the light from the clock can no longer catch up to him. The faster he races through space, the slower he moves through time. This sparks the birth of Einstein’s “Special Theory of Relativity”, which says that space and time are deeply connected.</blockquote>\n2. How will you organize the reading project?\n2.

Tom only remembered they were both in a green T-shirt the day his brother was missing. One day, when Tom was walking along the street, he saw a green T-shirt. Then he heard a voice saying the T-shirt was nice. Tom looked back and saw a young man. They were both surprised as they looked the same. They immediately talked to each other. The young man said he was adopted and couldn’t remember much about his biological family. He only remembered that he was in a green T-shirt when he got lost. Tom burst into tears as he found his brother.</blockquote>\n219. \n219. <blockquote>Tom had a twin brother. His brother went lost when he was five. Tom didn’t remember much about his brother.

And yet they are still the least explored. Hidden beneath the waves, there are creatures beyond our imagination. From creating the weather to producing oxygen, the seas keep our world healthy. With revolutionary technology, we can enter new worlds and shine the light on behaviors in ways that were impossible just a generation ago. We’ve also recognized an uncomfortable fact. They’re changing at a faster rate than ever before in human history. In the Arctic, here in the past [30/thirty] years, the ice in summer has been reduced by [40%/forty percent].</blockquote>\n2.

The public were fascinated but also troubled by what they saw, because it was widely believed that the people of the Dark Continent had no history and no culture and the thing called civilization. In fact, created from the [16th/sixteenth] century onwards in the ancient West African kingdom, these works record Benin’s great kings, her wealth, power and the history that Africans were supposed to lack. They are now regarded as one of Africa’s greatest treasures.</blockquote>\n2. Who gave the lectures to the students?\n2. Who delivered the lectures to the students?\n2.

One day, he walked out and read a book on his way as usual. Soon he ran into a cow and fell down, dropping his glasses on the floor. He thought he might have hit a fat man. He said sorry politely. But when putting on his glasses, he realized he was wrong. He laughed and moved forward. Soon, he focused on his book again. Several minutes later, he fell over again. Both his book and glasses were lost. He thought he might be hit by someone again. So he shouted angrily, but nobody answered. After putting on his glasses, he saw a woman standing near him. She was scared and ran away immediately. In fact, it was a big stone beside his feet.</blockquote>\n112. \n112. <blockquote>Tom likes reading storybooks while walking.

Suddenly, its owner Mary showed up and asked Tom to give it back. After she got the empty purse, she was angry and asked where Tom hid her money. Tom replied that it was empty when he found it.

But there’s a lot more to our ancient connection with the sea than just food. The more we’ve come to depend on the ocean, and the further we’ve pushed into its vast frontier, the greater its influence has become in our lives. The Pacific covers one third of the globe. The tiny specks of land in the middle of it are about as remote as life can get for a human being. With so few options on land, the surrounding ocean underpins almost every aspect of life on a Pacific island.</blockquote>\n2. Where are they transporting the crocodiles?\n2.

At last, the king ordered his men to take away the horse. The king’s youngest son Tom asked for a chance to manage the horse and the king agreed. Tom ran up to the horse and turned its head towards the sun. He had noticed that the horse was afraid of his own shadow. He then spoke sweetly to the horse and gently rubbed its head. When he had calmed the horse, he jumped onto the horse’s back quickly and let it run as fast as it could. All the men cheered when they saw Tom had proved himself to be the master of the horse. After that, Tom and the horse became best friends and they were always together.</blockquote>\n139. \n139. <blockquote>One day, King Philip bought a fine horse in a very high price.

What makes you the person you are? The story of each and every one of us can be traced back millions of years to the plains of ancient Africa. The answers to the question — what makes us human — lie buried in the ground, in the fossils and other traces of our ancestors, but also lie deep within our own bodies, in our bones, flesh and genes. As an anatomist, I am fascinated by the way our bodies had been sculpted by our ancestors’ struggle for survival.</blockquote>\n2. How much is the whale watching tour?\n2.

If he felt bad about his drawings, he would roll them off and throw them away. Whenever this happened, his grandma would encourage him to try again. Years went by, Tom was now a famous painter. One day, he was invited to provide his earlier works for an exhibition. Tom liked this idea and searched the house for them. He only found several pieces of his works, but not enough for the exhibition, so he felt upset. Knowing this, his grandma showed him a huge box, in which were the drawings he threw away in the past. Every drawing was well kept and marked with the date when Tom drew it. Tom felt deeply touched and gave his grandma a big hug.</blockquote>\n136. \n136. <blockquote>When Tom was little, he was fond of drawing and always wanted to draw perfect pictures.

It’s home to the West End, a small area of Central London with some of the most famous theatres in the world. Not far away, there’s the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, arguably the most prestigious drama school in the world. Many of today’s famous actors started their careers at this school. Before RADA and the West End, Shakespeare had made London his home. After he became a famous playwright, the shrewd Shakespeare opened his own theatre, the Globe. Today a recreated version of the Globe Theatre attracts thousands of visitors a year.</blockquote>\n2. Why do you want to learn to play tennis?\n2. Why would you like to learn to play tennis?\n2.

He had known that there might be some mysterious rock paintings in the caves, so he often went to look for them, but he never found any painting. One day, Tom took his daughter Mary to explore one of the caves again. While Tom was looking for the paintings, Mary went for a walk by herself in the cave. Suddenly, Mary shouted that she saw some horses. Tom went up to her and asked where the horses were. Mary pointed to the top. Tom sat down on the ground and looked up, and he saw some paintings of red horses. Later, Tom invited some experts to study the paintings in the cave.

The building has a new kind of green construction that is becoming popular in Europe. It is made of recycled shipping containers. The shipping containers bring goods back and forth between Asia and Europe. But the trade is mostly one way because it’s too expensive to send empty containers back thousands of kilometers. In the past, the empty containers became junk and a problem for the ports. Now the containers are used as a quick and cheap way to build homes, schools and offices.</blockquote>\n2.

Some experts say doing arts and crafts at home and at school can help build those abilities. Mary is an art therapist who teaches at New York University. She says that because the creative process requires invention and trial-and-error, children can learn to manage frustration through art.

Last Sunday afternoon, when he was going back to school, his mother put some apples in his bags and told him to eat one every day. After Tom arrived at school, he decided to share the apples with his friends in the dormitory. To his surprise, he found that everyone had brought different things from home to share. One brought a pot of flowers and another brought some interesting books. The biggest surprise came from a boy who took out several paintings.

She liked spending all her time with the flowers in her shop. There were many kinds of flowers in her shop and some of them had won prizes in competitions. However, some naughty boys from the nearby middle school often threw stones at her shop. Mary was afraid that the glass would break someday. She had tried many ways to protect the glass, like talking to the headmaster and picking up all the stones around her shop, but none of them worked. Mary felt frustrated. At last, she came up with an idea. She put up a board 10 meters away from her shop and wrote some words on it which read “Do not throw stones at this notice.” After that, the boys threw stones at the notice rather than throwing them at her shop.</blockquote>\n103. \n103. <blockquote>Mary owned a flower shop.

But that taste bud tally can’t compare to the catfish. Even a 15-centimeter catfish has at least a quarter of a million taste buds. The granddaddies — who live up to [60/sixty] years, and can weigh almost [300/three hundred] kilograms — have more than a million. How do they fit all those taste buds in their mouth? They don’t. They have taste buds all over their bodies, a quality which has earned them a reputation as swimming tongues. Every square centimeter of a catfish’s sleek, scale-free body contains 6 times as many taste buds as people have in their mouths.</blockquote>\n2. Does cycling in a city have any disadvantages?\n2.

Just two months old the cub is still very dependent on his mother. Ying Hua, 14, is an experienced mother. To take care of the baby, she has been around day and night, always holding her precious baby tightly in her arms. Compared with the time when he was born, Ying Hua’s cub has grown a lot. The hair around his eyes, ears and limbs has completely turned black, giving rise to the unique appearance of a giant panda. Although giant panda cubs are sleeping most of the time, they grow up surprisingly fast. Ying Hua’s cub is no exception.</blockquote>\n2. When did you change your mind?\n3.

The elephants are still searching for water. They’ve survived so far by draining the last drops from dried-up water holes. The oldest member of the herd must lead them to water soon. With a mental map formed over decades, she’s brought the family to an ancient seep. It’s a hidden lifeline in times of drought. The elephants can smell the water through the earth, and they know that to get to it, they must dig. For the adults, it’s easy. But for calves, it’s more of a challenge. They won’t have tusks to dig with until they’re two years old.</blockquote>\n2. How many performances were there at the Theatre Festival?\n2. How many performances did the Theatre Festival have?\n2.

Tom’s father knew how expensive that spaceship was. But seeing Tom’s excitement, he promised that Tom would have his spaceship on his birthday. On the day of his birthday, Tom didn’t see the spaceship and his heart was down. Just then, a voice came and Tom saw Dad riding on a spaceship. The spaceship was made out of a big box and it had wings and big room to ride on. Tom jumped into the spaceship excitedly and started a space exploration with his father. On that day, Father and Son happily explored the space of their living room, kitchen, and backyard.</blockquote>\n157. \n157. <blockquote>Tom liked space and everything about it.

Well, the ancient Maya believed they could answer that question. The Maya lived here, in parts of Mexico and Central America. They are famous for their complex calendars. In Mayan cities, they closely watched the movement of the sun, moon, stars, and planets. They built their kings’ tombs under rays of sunlight. And they waited for the moon to pass here above the palace before they got the crops out of the fields. Their knowledge of the sun and moon helped them make their calendar.</blockquote>\n2.

His friend gave him a young apple tree as a gift. Tom decided to plant it in the forest near his house. He thought, with those trees around, no one else could see his apple tree. Tom went to take care of the tree every day, but it didn’t grow well. A year later, the tree died for lack of sunlight. Tom’s friend knew it, and asked Tom why he had planted the tree in that place. Tom said that if he had planted it in the garden, people could easily see it and they would steal the apples.

One day, his friend gave a young apple tree to him as a present.

Brain rays show that sometimes parts of a baby’s brain make unusual turns, so a young baby may hear a loud noise and feel it in their fingertips. They could see a bright light and experience the sensation of smelling it. This is because the trillions of connections between their brain cells are not yet properly organized. So they are tasting in color and smelling in sound. It sounds like a disadvantage but it means their brains can adapt to any situation, even one of the most challenging experiences imaginable.</blockquote>\n2.

After three months of training, the master had taught Tom only one move. Tom asked the master why and the master just asked him to keep practicing, and said he would know. Several months later, the master took Tom to his first competition and Tom easily won his first two matches. The third match was more difficult, but finally, Tom used his one move to win the match. In the final, Tom’s competitor was bigger, stronger and more experienced, but Tom used his one move again and won the match. Now he was the champion. He asked the master why he could win the competition with only one move. The master told Tom he won for two reasons — First, he’d mastered the most difficult move, and second, the only defense for that move was for the competitors to catch his left arm. Tom’s biggest weakness had become his biggest strength.</blockquote>\n145. \n145. <blockquote>Tom lost his left arm in a car accident. He decided to learn Taichi.

As many as [100/a hundred] rainforest species go extinct every day, often before they’ve even been discovered. And it’s not just animals and plants. We’re also losing human cultures that we know almost nothing about. Even in the [21st/twenty-first] century, there are still people who exist in isolation from the rest of humanity, and virtually all live in jungles. These vast, unexplored forests are the only places left on Earth where entire communities can live undetected. Brazil is thought to be home to around 70 isolated tribes, around two-thirds of the world total.</blockquote>\n2. What does this musical tell?\n2. What does the musical tell?\n2.

He was very anxious and searched his memory hard. Then he realised he had left it at the library, but when he got there the next day, all he could find was a shining, clean reading room. So he went to the lost-and-found, but no wallet was turned in. Finally, he accepted that his wallet was gone. A week later, Tom received a package in the mail.  It was his wallet and nothing was missing. The person didn’t even leave a return address so Tom couldn’t think whoever it was. He felt that this was an act of pure kindness. From that day on, he promised that whenever he could help others, he would follow this example and pass on the kindness.</blockquote>\n337. \n337. <blockquote>Tom couldn’t find his wallet.

As well as growing new talents, we also think of this stage of childhood as a time of growing upwards. But the strange thing is our growth actually slows right down. In studying our consumption of energy, scientists have provided one of the reasons why we take so long to grow up. It’s a trade off between growing our body versus growing our brain. We simply can’t get enough calories to fully grow both at the same time.</blockquote>\n2. Did you really see giraffes in the hotel?\n2. Did you really see giraffes at the hotel?\n2.

However, one rainy day, Tom’s mother asked him to go outside with her. When they were out, she showed him how to collect water in a bottle. Tom was surprised to watch the bottle fill up with water in a short time. As they collected water, his mother explained how important water is. As a result, Tom realised everything around us depends on water. Then Tom’s mother taught him how to make use of the rain in their garden. It made Tom feel like he was doing something important. From that day on, Tom welcomed rainy days with open arms.

Soon, everything begins to collapse. These are signs of what could be a powerful earthquake. We’ve seen the destruction they can cause. Some of us may have even lived through one. We know they can be highly damaging. So we need to prepare for them. Engineers are designing buildings that are stronger and more flexible. Scientists are looking for ways to predict future earthquakes and learn when and where they will strike next. All these efforts are made in hopes that we can one day predict earthquakes accurately.</blockquote>\n2. How did you develop the habit of using reusable bags?\n2.

He thought if he could be a part of their group, he would be popular in his school. However, the older boys were not good people and were often absent from school. One day, they asked Tom to steal money from his father. Tom wanted to impress them so badly that he agreed. Sadly, Tom’s father caught him and asked him why he did that.

Many kinds of produce are judged on unrealistic standards of beauty. Thus, there’s a lot of produce that doesn’t make it to market. It could be a little too big or a little too small. There’s nothing wrong with the produce except that it’s ugly. In fact, about a third of the planet’s fruit and vegetables go to waste due to those strict standards. However, the standards don’t affect taste or nutrition at all. To reduce waste, we should make use of all of the food that farmers grow for us.</blockquote>\n2. Why did you go to see her?\n2.

There was a small stream running through the park and the water was very clear. But what Mary loved most was the beautiful cranes playing in the water. One day, Mary saw some naughty boys throwing stones at the cranes in the park. Mary was so angry that she ran to the boys and tried to stop them. One of the boys said that they wanted to see the cranes fly. Suddenly, a crane flew up and came straight to that boy. The crane patted the boy’s head with its big wings. All of the boys were scared and ran away. Mary came to the park the next day and put up a sign by the river, reading “Be friendly with birds.”</blockquote>\n273. \n273. <blockquote>Mary lived near a beautiful park.

We are more than seven billion. Every second that goes by, there are two more people on the planet to be fed. And we are hungry, so, naturally, we turn to the ocean to feed us. Three billion human beings depend directly on marine resources. For almost a billion people, fish represent their only source of animal proteins. The ocean is key to our survival. Four million of our fishing boats set out each day to attack the ocean. Since the beginning, our fishing has been a family craft, practised and transmitted from generation to generation.</blockquote>\n2. When do you usually see the animals on the farm?\n2.

Worldwide, including indirect employment and families, fishing sustains [500/five hundred] million people. Here, I see the abundance of the ocean. The ocean brings us other food. Since the very beginning of our history, we have gathered wild seaweeds on the shore. They have existed for three and a half billion years. We learned to cultivate the sea as we came to farm the land. The seaweed needs only six weeks of growth before harvest. It requires only sunlight and the movement of the currents.</blockquote>\n2.

He got up at six every day and went jogging with a loudspeaker broadcasting exciting music. Besides, he practised singing in the front yard day and night because his dream was to join the chorus of the city. Tom’s neighbour was an unhappy old lady who often looked tired and seemed easy to get annoyed. One day, Tom asked her why she was always worried. It was then that he realized it was because of his noise. He played music and sang songs too loud. Tom felt ashamed and sincerely apologized to the old lady. Since then, he used earphones while jogging and practised singing in the study room with windows closed.

Later, Mary led them to have a look at the pumpkins. The pumpkins were so big that all her friends were shocked. One of the pumpkins weighed around [100/one hundred] pounds. It took nearly two kids to move it. Mary asked them to take some pumpkins home for their family. They all thanked her and never laughed at her hobby anymore.

It allows us to have physical contact with our environment and functions like an alarm system. Even more astonishing is the fact that touch, through hugs and caresses, is good for our health. It stimulates our immune system so that our bodies can better protect us against attack! In small children, physical contact helps the brain to develop harmoniously.

It can speed up to [60/sixty] miles per hour and carry [100/one hundred] passengers in each section, much more than a regular bus. The [IRT/I R T] communicates with traffic lights intelligently and uses sensors to follow road markers. This enables the vehicle to autonomously make its way through urban roads.

Mary had always been interested in robot design and had won some prizes before, so she wanted to take part in it. She found that her classmate Tom had formed a team with two other boys for the competition. Mary wanted to join them, but they didn’t know her well and doubted her ability, so they turned her down. One day, Mary heard them discussing a problem with their robot design, and it seemed they didn’t know how to deal with it. Mary did some research and worked out a good way to solve the problem. The next day, Mary told the boys about her solution. They gave it a try and it turned out that Mary’s solution really worked. They were glad that Mary was helpful and invited her to join the team.

Animals that spend a lot of time underwater have some incredible ways of exploiting the fact that bubbles reduce the density of water. These are emperor penguins. They store air in their feathers, which they release as clouds of bubbles. This makes the water around the penguin less dense and much easier to move through. It means the penguins can travel up to [50%/fifty percent] faster than if there were no bubbles.</blockquote>\n2. Why is the rent so low?\n2. Why is the rent so cheap?\n2.

This energy can be turned into electricity, even from small waves. Unlike solar or wind power, wave energy is reliable, working day and night and getting stronger in bad weather. Technology now let us capture this energy more efficiently. Devices in the ocean turn wave movement into electricity, which can power homes and cities, especially since many people live near coasts. But using wave energy is challenging because ocean water can damage devices. They need to be tough and protected against rust and water.</blockquote>\n2. How was your hometown then?\n2.

When he was driving near the stadium, he found it was rather quiet there. He realized he had come to the wrong stadium, so he drove towards the right stadium. Along the way, Tom saw his former teacher Mary carrying a large bag. He hesitated for a while, but he finally offered to drive Mary home. Mary was glad and accepted his help.

Now, cooling our buildings uses [10%/ten percent] of the world’s electricity, which is bad for the planet. But there are smart ideas to avoid this. For example, cities can plant more trees to make shade and cool down. Also, we can design buildings to stay cool naturally by thinking about how they face the sun and using things like wind towers. Another idea is to paint roofs white to reflect the sun. These methods can make inside cooler without needing to use air conditioners all the time.</blockquote>\n2.

Tom walked ahead and found himself in front of a river. He saw a woman washing clothes on the other side of the river. He shouted for help, asking for directions to get out of the jungle. The woman went into her house and then came out with a dog. She put something around the neck of the dog and pointed to Tom. Then the dog jumped into the water and swam towards Tom. When the dog reached him, Tom saw a bottle under its neck and found a piece of paper — a map of the jungle in it.

It brought light to once-dark streets and allowed people to stay awake and continue their activities even after the sun went down. However, this bright artificial light also led to a problem called light pollution. Light pollution happens when there is too much light. It disturbs the natural balance between day and night. It can be harmful to both animals and humans. For example, sea turtles get confused by the light from cities and have trouble finding their way to the ocean. Humans may experience vision decline and have trouble sleeping.</blockquote>\n2. What’s your favourite part of the film?\n2. What is your favourite part of this film?\n2.

One day, Mary shared her worries with her mom. To make Mary feel better, her mom would make a cake for Mary.

Mary explained those things would make her sick. Mary asked her mom why she had those suggestions. Her mom said although those things might not taste good on their own, they were important to make a delicious cake.

That’s like having five plastic bags filled with rubbish for every foot of the coastline in the world. This plastic waste spreads throughout the ocean, gathering in large areas and breaking down into tiny pieces. Some are mistakenly eaten by sea animals and most eventually sink to the bottom of the sea. To address this issue, we need to completely rethink our approach to plastic packaging.

Sam learnt everything quickly and was able to play beautiful music. Jack practised hard, but his performance was not as good as Sam’s. In a piano competition a year later, Sam won, while Jack didn’t get any awards. His mom comforted Jack and said he would do better next time, but Jack replied that he would never be as good as Sam. His mom explained that he just had to be the best version of himself through hard work. After their talk, Jack understood that he should focus on himself instead of comparing himself with others. From then on, Jack worked even harder and tried his best. His efforts paid off and he did better at the next competition.</blockquote>\n101. \n101. <blockquote>Jack and Sam were twins. At the age of 10, they were sent to take piano classes by their mother. Sam was quite clever and learnt things fast. He could play beautiful music. On the other hand, Jack practised hard each day, but his performance couldn’t match Sam’s. One year later, they took part in a piano competition. Sam won, but Jack did not receive any prizes. Jack was very frustrated. His mother comforted him and said he would make progress next time. Jack replied that he could never be as good as Sam, no matter how hard he worked. His mother explained that he didn’t need to be like Sam. He just had to be the best version of himself with hard work. After the talk, Jack understood that he should focus on himself rather than comparing himself to others. From then on, Jack practised even harder and tried his best without worrying about how well Sam would do. His hard work paid off. He did better at the next competition and took pride in himself.</blockquote>\n101. \n101. <blockquote>Jack and Sam were twins.
